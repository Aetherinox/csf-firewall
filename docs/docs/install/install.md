# Install CSF <!-- omit from toc -->

In the previous section, we covered how to install the required dependencies for CSF, download and extract the necessary files, and run the [csftest.pl](tests.md#csftestpl) script.  

If your tests were successful, you are now ready to install CSF on your server and begin configuring your new firewall. This section focuses on the **basic installation process** — detailed configuration will be covered in a later chapter.

## Before You Begin

This page includes installation instructions for numerous control panels, however, the install script has been developed to be automatic in how it detects what distro you are on, and if you are using any control panels such as cPanel / WHM, VestaCP, etc.

Typically, all users are going to run the same `install.sh` file, and then the installation wizard will detect if it needs to do anything extra. However, individual platforms instructions have been provided on this page.

If your distro or control panel is not mentioned here, follow the [Install: Generic](#install-generic) instructions, and CSF will automatically detect anything extra that it needs to do.

<br />

---

<br />

## Install: Generic

Before installing CSF, we need to make sure that no other firewalls are running. Use the commands below to disable any existing firewalls:

=== ":aetherx-axs-block-brick-fire: UFW"

    Stop and disable `ufw`

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop ufw
    sudo systemctl disable ufw
    ```

    Confirm `ufw` is disabled with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status ufw
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-block-brick-fire: Firewalld"

    Stop and disable `firewalld`

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop firewalld
    sudo systemctl disable firewalld
    ```

    Confirm `firewalld` is disabled with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status firewalld
    ```

<br />

??? note "Previous Chapter: Download"

    If coming from the previous [download](download.md) chapter, you should have downloaded a copy of CSF and extracted it on your server.  

    If so, skip ahead a few steps.

<br />

If you do not have the latest vesion of CSF downloaded; grab a copy with one of the following commands:

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zipper: .tgz"

    ```shell
    # Using wget (tgz)
    wget https://download.configserver.dev/csf.tgz

    # Using curl (tgz)
    curl -O https://download.configserver.dev/csf.tgz
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zip: .zip"

    ```shell
    # Using wget (zip)
    wget https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip

    # Using curl (zip)
    curl -O https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip
    ```

<br />

Decompress / unzip the downloaded archive file:

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zipper: .tgz"

    ```bash
    tar -xzf csf.tgz -C /tmp
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zip: .zip"

    ```bash
    unzip csf.zip -d /tmp
    ```

<br />

Run the CSF installation script:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```bash
      sudo sh /tmp/csf/install.sh
      ```

<br />

Follow any instructions on-screen. If prompted for any additional information, enter it. Once the wizard completes, you can confirm if CSF is installed and functioning by accessing your server via SSH, and running the CSF version command:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```shell
      sudo csf -v
      ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell
      csf: v15.10 (generic)
      ```

<br />

Confirm the status of `csf` by running:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```shell
      sudo systemctl status csf
      ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell
      ● csf.service - ConfigServer Security & Firewall - csf
          Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/csf.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
          Active: active (exited) since Mon 2025-09-15 23:45:04 UTC; 14 seconds ago
        Main PID: 597 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
              CPU: 0min 14.956s

      Notice: journal has been rotated since unit was started, output may be incomplete.
      ```

<br />


??? warning "Testing Mode Disables LFD"

    If you have not yet disabled testing mode in the `csf.conf`, lfd will be unable to start. Performing this step is covered in the next [Configuration](../usage/configuration.md) chapter.

<br />

If you receive the expected response, you can skip the remaining steps on this page and continue to the [Next Steps](#next-steps) section. Detailed instructions on using CSF will be provided in the next chapter of this guide.

<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

## Install: cPanel and WHM

Installing CSF for WHM is almost the same process outlined in the [Install: Generic](#install-generic) steps, just with different extraction paths, and how you will access the CSF web interface.

<br />

Log in as the `root` user via SSH.

=== ":aetherx-axs-key: Using Password"

    ```shell
    ssh -vvv root@XX.XX.XX.XX -p 22
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file: Using Private Key"

    ```shell
    ssh -i /path/to/private_key -vvv root@XX.XX.XX.XX -p 22
    ```

<br />

You must already have cPanel installed to your server. cPanel offers a [15-day free trial](https://cpanel.net/products/trial/), or you can [purchase a license](https://cpanel.net/pricing/). To install and activate a free trial, run the following command on your server:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```shell
      cd /home && sudo curl -o latest -L https://securedownloads.cpanel.net/latest && sudo sh latest
      ```

<br />

The installation of **cPanel** usually takes between **5 and 20 minutes**, depending on your server’s hardware and internet connection, as it installs and configures a large number of system packages.  

While the installation is in progress, you’ll need to [**create a cPanel account**](https://store.cpanel.net/register.php). This account is required to activate your free trial or paid license, and you’ll use it to sign in once the installation finishes.  

<br />

After the installation completes, you’ll see output similar to the following in your terminal:

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell
      [19126] ( INFO): Flushing the task queue
      [19126] ( INFO): cPanel install finished in 6 minutes and 28 seconds!
      [19126] ( INFO): Congratulations! Your installation of cPanel & WHM 11.130 is now complete. The next step is to configure your server. 
      [19126] ( INFO): 
      [19126] ( INFO): Before you configure your server, ensure that your firewall allows access on port 2087.
      [19126] ( INFO): 
      [19126] ( INFO): After ensuring that your firewall allows access on port 2087, you can configure your server.
      [19126] ( INFO): 
      [19126] ( INFO): 1. Open your preferred browser
      [19126] ( INFO): 
      [19126] ( INFO): 2. Navigate to the following url using the address bar and enter this one-time autologin url:
      [19126] ( INFO): 
      [19126] ( INFO): https://cp.configserver.dev:2087/cpsess4927138456/login/?session=root%x7rGd9PLkWqz3YFb2t%3acreate_user_session%f8b47c19a5de91b03ce6f20dbb1847e9d2
      ```

<br />

Open the link in your browser and begin activating cPanel. Copy/paste the link you were provided in the terminal into your browser. 

<figure markdown="span">
    ![cPanel › WHM Introduction Screen](../assets/images/install/cpanel/1.png){ width="700" }
    <figcaption>cPanel › WHM Introduction Screen</figcaption>
</figure>

<br />

During setup, you may be prompted to review and accept the **cPanel License Agreement** or **Terms of Use**.  

On the following page, click **Log in to cPanel Store** button in the lower-right corner to activate your license. You will be prompted to sign into your cPanel account that you created earlier.  

If you ever need to verify your cPanel license later, you can do so by running the command below in your terminal:


=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```shell
      sudo /usr/local/cpanel/cpkeyclt
      ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell
      Updating cPanel license...Done. Update succeeded.
      ```

<br />

If you get the following response from running the command, you will need to reach out to the [cPanel Support Team](https://support.cpanel.net/hc/en-us/requests/new) by creating a ticket.

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell
      Updating cPanel license...Done. Update Failed!
      Error message:
      The cPanel license server said that a license could not be issued for your server (66).
      For more information visit: https://www.cpanel.net/lic/

      The exact message was: No valid cPanel/WHM license found. (XX.XX.XX.XX)
      ```

<br />

Complete the cPanel Activation Wizard, and at some point, you will be taken to the homepage of WHM:

<figure markdown="span">
    ![WHM › Home](../assets/images/install/cpanel/2.png){ width="700" }
    <figcaption>WHM › Home</figcaption>
</figure>

<br />

Set WHM aside for a moment. Next, we need to ensure that we don't have any existing firewalls that need to be disabled. Run the commands below to disable them:

=== ":aetherx-axs-block-brick-fire: UFW"

    Stop and disable `ufw`

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop ufw
    sudo systemctl disable ufw
    ```

    Confirm `ufw` is disabled with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status ufw
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-block-brick-fire: Firewalld"

    Stop and disable `firewalld`

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop firewalld
    sudo systemctl disable firewalld
    ```

    Confirm `firewalld` is disabled with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status firewalld
    ```

<br />

??? note "Previous Chapter: Download"

    If coming from the previous [download](download.md) chapter, you should have downloaded a copy of CSF and extracted it on your server.  

    If so, skip ahead a few steps.

<br />

If you do not have the latest vesion of CSF downloaded; grab a copy with one of the following commands:

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zipper: .tgz"

    ```shell
    # Using wget (tgz)
    wget https://download.configserver.dev/csf.tgz

    # Using curl (tgz)
    curl -O https://download.configserver.dev/csf.tgz
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zip: .zip"

    ```shell
    # Using wget (zip)
    wget https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip

    # Using curl (zip)
    curl -O https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip
    ```

<br />

Decompress / unzip the downloaded archive file:

??? warning "Root required for tar extraction"

    On a cPanel server, you must extract CSF as **root** when decompressing to `/usr/src/`. Otherwise will you get the error:

      - `tar: csf: Cannot mkdir: Permission denied`

    You can also extract to `/tmp`

<br />

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zipper: .tgz"

    ```bash
    tar -xzf csf.tgz -C /usr/src/
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zip: .zip"

    ```bash
    unzip csf.zip -d /usr/src/
    ```

<br />

Run the CSF installation script:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```bash
      sudo sh /usr/src/csf/install.sh
      ```

<br />

Follow any instructions on-screen. If prompted for any additional information, enter it. Once the wizard completes, you can confirm if CSF is installed and functioning by accessing your server via SSH, and running the CSF version command:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```shell
      sudo csf -v
      ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell
      csf: v15.01 (cPanel)
      ```

<br />

Confirm the status of `csf` by running:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```shell
      sudo systemctl status csf
      ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell
      ● csf.service - ConfigServer Security & Firewall - csf
          Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/csf.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
          Active: active (exited) since Mon 2025-09-15 23:45:04 UTC; 14 seconds ago
        Main PID: 597 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
              CPU: 0min 14.956s

      Notice: journal has been rotated since unit was started, output may be incomplete.
      ```

<br />


??? warning "Testing Mode Disables LFD"

    If you have not yet disabled testing mode in the `csf.conf`, lfd will be unable to start. Performing this step is covered in the next [Configuration](../usage/configuration.md) chapter.

<br />

If you received the expected response, CSF has successfully installed. Next, log back into your WHM control panel at `https://domain.lan:2087` or `https://127.0.0.1:2087`. On the left-side WHM menu, navigate to:

  - WHM » Home » Plugins » `ConfigServer Security & Firewall` 

<figure markdown="span">
    ![WHM › Plugins › ConfigServer Security & Firewall](../assets/images/install/cpanel/3.png){ width="700" }
    <figcaption>WHM › Plugins › ConfigServer Security & Firewall</figcaption>
</figure>

<br />

If you see **ConfigServer Security & Firewall** within your **WHM › Plugins** menu, this means that CSF has been successfully integrated and is ready to [configure](../usage/configuration.md). You can skip the remaining steps on this page and continue to the [Next Steps](#next-steps) section. Detailed instructions on using CSF will be provided in the next chapter of this guide.

<br />

<br />
<br />

## Install: Webmin

Installing CSF with Webmin integration is straightforward. Simply install Webmin first, then install CSF, and finally add the CSF module to Webmin to complete the integration.

<br />

Log in as the `root` user via SSH.

=== ":aetherx-axs-key: Using Password"

    ```shell
    ssh -vvv root@XX.XX.XX.XX -p 22
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file: Using Private Key"

    ```shell
    ssh -i /path/to/private_key -vvv root@XX.XX.XX.XX -p 22
    ```

<br />

Ensure you have Webmin installed. If not, download the Webmin installer script:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```shell
      curl -o webmin-setup-repo.sh \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webmin/webmin/master/webmin-setup-repo.sh
      ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell
        % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                      Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

      ```

<br />

Run the Webmin installer:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```shell
      sudo sh webmin-setup-repo.sh
      ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell

<br />

After installation is complete, open your browser and navigate to:

- `https://127.0.0.1:10000/`

<br />

You should be greeted with a Webmin authentication page. Test signing in to make sure you have root access. The username and password will be associated with your root account on your server.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Webmin Login Screen](../assets/images/install/webmin/1.png){ width="700" }
    <figcaption>Webmin Login Screen</figcaption>
</figure>

<br />

Put Webmin aside for a moment; we need to make sure that we don't have any existing firewalls that need disabled. If so, run the commands below:

=== ":aetherx-axs-block-brick-fire: UFW"

    Stop and disable `ufw`

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop ufw
    sudo systemctl disable ufw
    ```

    Confirm `ufw` is disabled with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status ufw
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-block-brick-fire: Firewalld"

    Stop and disable `firewalld`

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop firewalld
    sudo systemctl disable firewalld
    ```

    Confirm `firewalld` is disabled with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status firewalld
    ```

<br />

We are ready to install CSF, which you should already have downloaded to your system. If not; download the latest version of CSF:

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zipper: .tgz"

    ```shell
    # Using wget (tgz)
    wget https://download.configserver.dev/csf.tgz

    # Using curl (tgz)
    curl -O https://download.configserver.dev/csf.tgz
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zip: .zip"

    ```shell
    # Using wget (zip)
    wget https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip

    # Using curl (zip)
    curl -O https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip
    ```

<br />

Decompress / unzip the downloaded archive file:

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zipper: .tgz"

    ```bash
    tar -xzf csf.tgz -C /tmp
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zip: .zip"

    ```bash
    unzip csf.zip -d /tmp
    ```

<br />

Run the CSF installation script:

=== ":aetherx-axd-circle-1: Option 1"

    :aetherx-axd-circle-1: Runs `install.sh` :aetherx-axd-dot: uses `sh` shell :aetherx-axd-dot: executable permission not required

    ```bash
    sudo sh /tmp/csf/install.sh
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axd-circle-2: Option 2"

    :aetherx-axd-circle-2: Runs `install.sh` :aetherx-axd-dot: uses shebang interpreter :aetherx-axd-dot: requires executable `+x` permission

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /tmp/csf/install.sh
    sudo /tmp/csf/install.sh
    ```

<br />

Follow any instructions on-screen. If prompted for any additional information, enter it.

<br />

Log back into Webmin. Once in, navigate to **Webmin Configuration** › **Webmin Modules** from the left-hand menu.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Webmin Configuration](../assets/images/install/webmin/2.png){ width="700" }
    <figcaption>Webmin Configuration › Webmin Modules</figcaption>

## Install: InterWorx

Installing CSF with InterWorx integration is simple. First we need to install InterWorx, then install CSF, and finally enable the CSF module within InterWorx to complete the integration.

<br />

Log in as the `root` user via SSH.

=== ":aetherx-axs-key: Using Password"

    ```shell
    ssh -vvv root@XX.XX.XX.XX -p 22
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file: Using Private Key"

    ```shell
    ssh -i /path/to/private_key -vvv root@XX.XX.XX.XX -p 22
    ```

<br />

Ensure you have InterWorx installed. If not, download the installer script:

??? note "Valid TLD / Host Required"

    Before installing InterWorx, you must set your server's hostname to a valid host.

<br />

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Install (Option 1)"

      ```shell
      sudo sh <((curl -sL updates.interworx.com/interworx/8/install.sh))
      ```

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Install (Option 2)"

      ```shell
      wget updates.interworx.com/interworx/8/install.sh
      sudo sh install.sh
      ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell
      STATUS: Determining Linux distribution
      STATUS: Checking network interface names

      -=-=-=-=-= Installing InterWorx-CP =-=-=-=-=-

      This script will install InterWorx-CP on your system.
      Please make sure that you have backed up any critical
      data!

      This script may be run multiple times without any
      problems.  This is helpful if you find an error
      during installation, you can safely ctrl-c out of
      this script, fix the error and re-start the script.

      STATUS: Checking Hostname
      The hostname 'configserver.dev' is valid.

      Details of this installation will be logged in iworx-install.log

      HOSTNAME   : configserver.dev
      TARGET     : CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core)
      PLATFORM   : GNU/Linux
      PROCESSOR  : x86_64
      RPM TARGET : rhe7x
      RPM DISTRO : cos7x
      RPM DIR    : /usr/src/redhat/RPMS

      IWORX REPO : ga
      DEFAULT PHP: PHP 8.2
      MYSQL      : MARIADB 10.6
      ```
  
<br />

While the installation is in progress, you’ll need to have a valid **license key** which InterWorx setup wizard will ask for once you access the web control panel. InterWorx offers a **2 week** free trial license key which you can [apply for here](https://interworx.com/interworx-demos/)

At the end of the installation, you'll be provided with a link you must visit in order to activate InterWorx.

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell
      -=-=-=-=-= Installation Complete! Next Step: License Activation! =-=-=-=-=-

      To activate your license, go to
      https://your-ip:2443/nodeworx/
      or run: ~iworx/bin/goiworx.pex
      Also, check out https://www.interworx.com for news, updates, and support!

      -=-=-=-=-= THANK YOU FOR USING INTERWORX! =-=-=-=-=-
      ```

<br />

After installation is complete, open your browser and navigate to:

- `https://your-ip:2443/nodeworx/`
- `https://127.0.0.1:2443/nodeworx/`

<br />

You should be greeted with a InterWorx authentication page. Provide a valid e-mail address, password, and finally, provide your **license key**.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![InterWorx › Login Screen](../assets/images/install/interworx/1.png){ width="700" }
    <figcaption>InterWorx › Login Screen</figcaption>
</figure>

<br />

Once you input the information asked, InterWorx will also ask you to provide valid **nameservers**. For our docs, we will provide:

- `ns1.configserver.dev`
- `ns2.configserver.dev`

<br />

InterWorx should start the installation process. At this point, InterWorx will take anywhere around **5-10 minutes** to complete.

</figure>

<br />

Once installation is complete, navigate to the **InterWorx dashboard** or homepage.

You’ll be prompted to review and accept the **End User License Agreement (EULA)**.

Although it may seem lengthy, it’s strongly recommended that you **read it carefully** to understand what permissions InterWorx requires and what terms you’re agreeing to.

    and if Licensee is not in breach of this Agreement.
    In addition, Licensor may provide such maintenance and
    support services separately as set forth in Licensee’s
    Order Form and subject to the terms of this Agreement.
    Licensee acknowledges that Maintenance and support
    services do not include any new version or new release

          of this Agreement and enforcing the Licensor’s
          rights, including all Intellectual Property Rights
          in and to the Software.

    9. Intellectual Property Rights.

    Documentation are provided under license, and not sold,
    to Licensee. Licensee does not acquire any ownership
    interest in the Software or Documentation under this

    business in the normal course, admits its insolvency,
    makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or
    becomes the subject of any judicial or administrative
    proceedings in bankruptcy, receivership or
    reorganization. Upon expiration or earlier termination
    of this Agreement, the license granted hereunder shall
    also terminate, and Licensee shall cease using and
    destroy all copies of the Software and Documentation.
    No expiration or termination shall affect Licensee’s
    obligation to pay all Licensee Fees and maintenance
    and support fees, if applicable, that may have become
    due before such expiration or termination, or entitle
    Licensee to any refund.

    12. Limited Warranty, Exclusive Remedy, and Disclaimer.

        - (b) Licensor will not be responsible or liable
          to Licensee, or deemed in default or breach
          hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in
          the performance of its obligations hereunder
          where such failure or delay is due to strikes,
          labor disputes, civil disturbances, riot,
          rebellion, invasion, epidemic, hostilities, war,
          terrorist attack, embargo, natural disaster,
          acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage, fluctuations

    <figcaption>InterWorx › Dashboard</figcaption>
</figure>

<br />

Set InterWorx aside for a moment; we need to make sure that we don't have any existing firewalls that need disabled. If so, run the commands below:

=== ":aetherx-axs-block-brick-fire: UFW"

    Stop and disable `ufw`

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop ufw
    sudo systemctl disable ufw
    ```

    Confirm `ufw` is disabled with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status ufw
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-block-brick-fire: Firewalld"

    Stop and disable `firewalld`

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop firewalld
    sudo systemctl disable firewalld
    ```

    Confirm `firewalld` is disabled with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status firewalld
    ```

<br />

We are ready to install CSF, which you should already have downloaded to your system. If not; download the latest version of CSF:

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zipper: .tgz"

    ```shell
    # Using wget (tgz)
    wget https://download.configserver.dev/csf.tgz

    # Using curl (tgz)
    curl -O https://download.configserver.dev/csf.tgz

    ```shell
    # Using wget (zip)
    wget https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip

    # Using curl (zip)
    curl -O https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip
    ```

<br />

Decompress / unzip the downloaded archive file:

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zipper: .tgz"

    ```bash
    tar -xzf csf.tgz -C /tmp
    ```

    ```bash
    unzip csf.zip -d /tmp
    ```

<br />

Run the CSF installation script:

=== ":aetherx-axd-circle-1: Option 1"

    :aetherx-axd-circle-1: Runs `install.sh` :aetherx-axd-dot: uses `sh` shell :aetherx-axd-dot: executable permission not required

    ```bash
    sudo sh /tmp/csf/install.sh
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axd-circle-2: Option 2"

    :aetherx-axd-circle-2: Runs `install.sh` :aetherx-axd-dot: uses shebang interpreter :aetherx-axd-dot: requires executable `+x` permission

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /tmp/csf/install.sh
    sudo /tmp/csf/install.sh
    ```

<br />

Follow any instructions on-screen. If prompted for any additional information, enter it.

## Install: VestaCP

??? danger "Danger: Security Vulnerabilities"

    As of **10/10/2025**, there are over **20** known [security vulnerabilities listed for VestaCP](https://cve.org/CVERecord/SearchResults?query=vesta). Take these warnings serious in terms of your decision to use VestaCP on outdated distros such as CentOS 7, which reached EOL on **June 30, 2024**.

??? bug "Bug: CSF Header Button"

    As of **VestaCP v1.0**, the application was migrated to **React**, which fundamentally changed how the web interface works. The UI is now compiled into a series of `.CSS` and `.JS` files, rather than using the older PHP/HTML templates.

    Because of this change, **CSF does not currently appear in the top menu** of VestaCP, even though the CSF page itself is still fully accessible at `https://192.168.0.16:5463/list/csf`.

    To restore the CSF menu link, the **VestaCP developers would need to add a conditional menu item** that detects when CSF is installed and ready to use. After they add this change to their source menu code, they can re-build the React .js file to push for public release.

    If you absolutely must have **CSF** in your main VestaCP top menu, follow the [instructions below](#add-csf-to-vestacp-menu).

    Unfortunately, due to the lack of recent updates from the VestaCP team, this integration may never be corrected, and users will need to access CSF directly via its URL.

    We have however, provided instructions on how you can get CSF to appear in the top menu, but it involves you re-building VestaCP yourself. If you are interested in this patch; [view the instructions below](#add-csf-to-vestacp-menu).

??? note "Note: Project Status Unknown"

    The current status of VestaCP is unknown. The developers [announced a release](https://vestacp.com/docs/vesta-2-development) of VestaCP 2.0 in 2024, however, no other information was given after that time.

    The [repository](https://github.com/outroll/vesta) has not been updated in over a year.

<br />

[Vesta](https://github.com/outroll/vesta) is an open-source hosting control panel designed to simplify server management tasks. It provides a clean and focused interface without unnecessary clutter, allowing users to efficiently manage their hosting environments. VestaCP supports various features, including:

- Web, DNS, and Mail Management: Easily manage domains, DNS records, and email accounts.
- Database Support: Create and manage MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.
- SSL Integration: Automatically generate SSL/TLS certificates with Let's Encrypt.
- Security Features: Configure firewalls and manage user access.
- Backup Solutions: Schedule and manage backups for your data.

Vesta is licensed under the [GPL v3 license](https://github.com/outroll/vesta/blob/master/LICENSE), ensuring that it remains free and open for community contributions.

<br />

| Distro | Supported Versions |
| --- | --- |
| :aetherx-axb-centos: RHEL / CentOS | 5, 6, 7 |
| :aetherx-axb-debian: Debian | 7, 8, 9 |
| :aetherx-axb-ubuntu: Ubuntu | 12.04 - 18.10 |

<br />

The installation of VestaCP is a bit different than our other instructions. We will need to generate a build command using their website, and then use that command to install VestaCP to your server.

<br />

Log in as the `root` user via SSH.

=== ":aetherx-axs-key: Using Password"

    ```shell
    ssh -vvv root@XX.XX.XX.XX -p 22
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file: Using Private Key"

    ```shell
    ssh -i /path/to/private_key -vvv root@XX.XX.XX.XX -p 22
    ```

<br />

??? warning "CentOS 7 Users"

    CentOS 7 has officially reached **End of Life (EOL)**, and its default YUM repositories were moved from `mirror.centos.org` to `vault.centos.org`.  
    Because of this change, new installations of CentOS 7 can no longer fetch or update packages until the repository URLs are updated.

    The commands below update your YUM repo configuration to point to the new CentOS Vault, allowing package installation and updates to work again.

    === ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

        ```shell
        sed -i 's/mirror\.centos\.org/vault.centos.org/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*.repo
        sed -i 's/^#.*baseurl=http/baseurl=http/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*.repo
        sed -i 's/^mirrorlist=http/#mirrorlist=http/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*.repo

        sudo yum clean all
        sudo yum update -y
        sudo reboot
        ```

        <br />

        Once you reboot, you should now be able to run `yum` commands once again to install or update packages.

<br />

Head over to their website so that you can generate an installation command that you will run in your shell:

- https://vestacp.com/install#install-configure

<br />

We did a very basic configuration:

- [x] Web: `Apache`
- [x] FTP: `No`
- [x] Mail: `No`
- [x] DNS: `No`
- [x] Firewall: `Iptables`
- [x] Softaculous: `Yes`
- [x] Additional Repository: `Yes`
- [x] File System Quota: `No`
- [x] DB : `None`
- [x] Hostname: `panel.configserver.dev`
- [x] Email: `user@configserver.dev`
- [x] Port: `5463`
- [x] Password: `*********************************`

<br />

Download the VestaCP installation script:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

    ```shell
    curl -O https://vestacp.com/pub/vst-install.sh
    ```

<br />

Next, we must use the command we generated earlier:

??? danger "**DANGER**: Plain-text Passwords in Terminal Commands"

    Supplying passwords directly in plain-text commands is strongly discouraged. Unfortunately, this is how VestaCP is currently configured.

    To reduce the risk, it is recommended to set `HISTCONTROL` to `ignorespace` and then prefix your command with a ++space++. This prevents the command from being recorded in your shell history.

    The codeblock below includes this command, and starts with a space character.

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

    ```shell
    export HISTCONTROL=ignorespace

     bash vst-install.sh \
       --nginx no \
       --apache yes \
       --phpfpm no \
       --vsftpd no \
       --proftpd no \
       --exim no \
       --dovecot no \
       --spamassassin no \
       --clamav no \
       --named no \
       --iptables yes \
       --fail2ban no \
       --softaculous yes \
       --remi yes \
       --quota no \
       --mysql no \
       --postgresql no \
       --hostname panel.configserver.dev \
       --email user@email.com \
       --port 5463 \
       --password *********************************
    ```

<br />

You will be given the following response in terminal:

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell
      _|      _|  _|_|_|_|    _|_|_|  _|_|_|_|_|    _|_|
      _|      _|  _|        _|            _|      _|    _|

                                        Vesta Control Panel



      The following software will be installed on your system:
        - Apache Web Server
        - Softaculous Plugin
        - Iptables Firewall


      Would you like to continue [y/n]: y
      ```

<br />

The installation of VestaCP will take anywhere from **5 - 15 minutes** depending on the specs of your server. Once the installation is complete, you'll see the following:

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell
      _|      _|  _|_|_|_|    _|_|_|  _|_|_|_|_|    _|_|

!!! bug inline end "Bug: VestaCP Header Fix"

    CSF [v15.02](../about/changelog.md#15.02) introduced a fix which allows the VestaCP header to once again show on the CSF page. 
    
    However, this does not address the VestaCP top nav menu not showing **CSF**.
    
    A fix for this has been provided as instructions [below](#add-csf-to-vestacp-menu).

As of **VestaCP v1.0**, the application was migrated to **React**, which fundamentally changes how the web interface works. The UI is now compiled into a series of `.CSS` and `.JS` files, rather than using the older PHP/HTML templates.

Because of this change, **CSF does not currently appear in the top menu** of VestaCP, even though the CSF page itself is still fully accessible at `https://192.168.0.16:5463/list/csf`.

If the interface matches the screenshot above, the CSF integration with VestaCP is complete.  

You can now proceed to the [Next Steps](#next-steps) or skip the rest of this section and begin our [Configuration](../usage/configuration.md) chapter to get things set up.

<br />
<br />

### Add CSF to VestaCP Menu

If you absolutely need CSF to appear in your VestaCP top nav menu, you're going to have to change the source file, re-build VestaCP, and replace your existing `index.html`, `.css` and `.js` files. We will provide very brief instructions.

<br />

If you already have VestaCP running on your server, then you should find everything in the folder:

- `/usr/local/vesta/`

<br />

If you need to clone the VestaCP repo to your server, run:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```bash
      sudo mkdir vestacp
      cd vestacp
      git clone https://github.com/outroll/vesta.git .
      ```

<br />

You should now have the full source to VestaCP on your server. We need to add a new menu item so that we can access CSF from the main VestaCP menu.

Open the file `/usr/local/vesta/src/react/src/components/MainNav/Panel/Panel.jsx`, and then find / replace with the codeblocks below:

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-magnifying-glass: Find"

    ``` jsx title="/usr/local/vesta/src/react/src/components/MainNav/Panel/Panel.jsx"
          {userName === 'admin' && (<>
            <div className={className("/list/updates/")}>
              <Link to="/list/updates/" onClick={event => handleState("/list/updates/", event)} onKeyPress={event => event.preventDefault()}>{i18n.Updates}</Link>
            </div>
            {session.FIREWALL_SYSTEM && <div className={className("/list/firewall/")}>
              <Link to="/list/firewall/" onClick={event => handleState("/list/firewall/", event)} onKeyPress={event => event.preventDefault()}>{i18n.Firewall}</Link>
            </div>}
          </>)}
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-pen: Change To"

    ``` jsx title="/usr/local/vesta/src/react/src/components/MainNav/Panel/Panel.jsx"
          {userName === 'admin' && (<>
            <div className={className("/list/updates/")}>
              <Link to="/list/updates/" onClick={event => handleState("/list/updates/", event)} onKeyPress={event => event.preventDefault()}>{i18n.Updates}</Link>
            </div>
            {session.FIREWALL_SYSTEM && <div className={className("/list/firewall/")}>
              <Link to="/list/firewall/" onClick={event => handleState("/list/firewall/", event)} onKeyPress={event => event.preventDefault()}>{i18n.Firewall}</Link>
            </div>}
            <div className={className("/list/csf/")}>
              <Link to="/list/csf/" onClick={event => handleState("/list/csf/", event)} onKeyPress={event => event.preventDefault()}>CSF</Link>
            </div>
          </>)}
    ```

<br />

In the code above, we've added a new **CSF** button to the right of the **Firewall** button. Save the file and exit. Next, we need to install the packages required to re-build VestaCP. For this, you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed. 

Once you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed, navigate to the `/usr/local/vesta/src/react` folder with the `package.json` file:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```bash
      cd /usr/local/vesta/src/react
      ```

<br />

The folder `/usr/local/vesta/src/react` should contain the following structure:

```
📁 usr
   📁 local
      📁 vesta
          📁 src
              📁 react
                📁 build
                📁 public
                📁 src
                📄 jsconfig.json
                📄 package.json
                📄 package-lock.json
                📄 README.md
```

<br />

We need to install the NodeJS dependencies that will be used to re-build VestaCP:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```bash
      sudo npm install --legacy-peer-deps
      ```

??? warning "Must Use `--legacy-peer-deps`"

    You **MUST** append `--legacy-peer-deps` to the `npm install` command; otherwise you will get the error:

    === ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

          ```

<br />

Next, we need to run the react build command:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```bash
      sudo npm run build
      ```

<br />

You will see a large number of warnings such as the following:

<br />

You can ignore these warnings, they are only displaying because the packages for VestaCP are extremely outdated. What you are looking for when you finish building with the command above is the following output:

=== ":aetherx-axs-square-terminal: Output"

      ```shell

        781 B      build/static/js/runtime-main.cb963cd4.js

      The project was built assuming it is hosted at /.
      You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.

      The build folder is ready to be deployed.
      You may serve it with a static server:

        npm install -g serve
        serve -s build
      ```

<br />

The build above should give you some new files located in `/usr/local/vesta/src/react/build/`. The ones you need are:

- 📁 `/usr/local/vesta/src/react/build/static`
- 📄 `/usr/local/vesta/src/react/build/index.html`

<br />

To replace the old VestaCP files with your new copies, run the following commands in order:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```bash
      # backup your existing static folder
      sudo cp -rf /usr/local/vesta/web/static/ /usr/local/vesta/web/static.backup/

      # remove the old files
      sudo rm -rf /usr/local/vesta/web/static/css /usr/local/vesta/web/static/js /usr/local/vesta/web/static/index.html

      # copy the static folder
      sudo cp -rf /usr/local/vesta/src/react/build/static/ /usr/local/vesta/web/

      # copy the index.html
      sudo cp /usr/local/vesta/src/react/build/index.html /usr/local/vesta/web/static/
      ```

<br />

Give VestCP's dashboard page a hard refresh:

| Browser | Hotkey |
| --- | --- |
| :aetherx-axb-chrome: **Chrome** | ++f5++ |
| :aetherx-axb-edge: **Edge** | ++f5++ |
| :aetherx-axb-firefox: **Firefox** | ++ctrl+f5++ |
| :aetherx-axb-opera: **Opera** | ++f5++ |
| :aetherx-axb-safari: **Safari** | ++cmd+option+r++ |

<br />

You should now see **CSF** at the top-right in the VestCP navigation menu.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![VestaCP › Nav Menu](../assets/images/install/vestacp/5.png){ width="700" }
    <figcaption>VestaCP › Nav Menu</figcaption>
</figure>

<br />

While we'd love to have a much simplier solution, this is about as close to a solution as we will get unless the developers of VestaCP decide to release a fix.

## Install: Cyberpanel

??? note "Automatic Installation Discontinued"

    When the original developer of CSF announced their plans to stop support for CSF in August 2025, Cyberpanel made the decision to remove automatic integration for CSF from their suite.

    If you would like to see CSF re-added, [reach out to Cyberpanel](https://cyberpanel.net/contact-us) and let them know.

Installing CSF with Cyberpanel integration is fairly straight-forward, but with a few notes. We need to download their official installation script under the `root` user, and then run the installation script.

First, download the script:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ```bash
      sudo wget -O - https://cyberpanel.net/install.sh > install.sh
      ```

<br />

There a few requirements to take note of when running the Cyberpanel installation script

1. You must run `install.sh` as root; sudo is not enough.
2. You are not allowed to run the installation script if you are within a DE (desktop environment) such as Gnome or KDE.
    - We're not sure of the reasoning behind this, but we'll play by the rules for our installation.

If you are currently within a desktop environment, you must go into the CLI. For this, we'll use:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

    ``` shell
    sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target
    ```

<br />

After you are in the CLI for your server, we'll login as root. If you accidentally log in as your normal user, you can simply `su` and then enter your root password.

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

    ``` shell
    su
    sh install.sh
    ```

<br />

This `install.sh` script will then download another script via curl named `cyberpanel.sh`. This script will download all of the required packages and install Cyberpanel.

You will be asked a series of questions. Follow the instructions on-screen, and press ++y++ or ++n++ depending on which packages you want installed.

The entire installation process takes roughly **5 to 15 minutes**. For this guide, we'll fast-forward to the final steps of installing Cyberpanel. One of the last things to print within your CLI will be credentials and the IP / port you'll use to access the Cyberpanel web interface.

Write all of this down in a secure place.

<br />

Set Cyberpanel aside for a moment; we need to make sure that we don't have any existing firewalls that need disabled. If so, run the commands below:

=== ":aetherx-axs-block-brick-fire: UFW"

    Stop and disable `ufw`

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop ufw
    sudo systemctl disable ufw
    ```

    Confirm `ufw` is disabled with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status ufw
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-block-brick-fire: Firewalld"

    Stop and disable `firewalld`

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop firewalld
    sudo systemctl disable firewalld
    ```

    Confirm `firewalld` is disabled with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status firewalld
    ```

<br />

We are ready to install CSF, which you should already have downloaded to your system. If not; download the latest version of CSF:

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zipper: .tgz"

    ```shell
    # Using wget (tgz)
    wget https://download.configserver.dev/csf.tgz

    # Using curl (tgz)
    curl -O https://download.configserver.dev/csf.tgz
    ```

    wget https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip

    # Using curl (zip)
    curl -O https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip
    ```

<br />

Decompress / unzip the downloaded archive file:

## Install: CentOS Web Panel

??? note "Automatic Legacy Installation"

    CentOS Web Panel (CWP) automatically installs CSF as part of its base installation.
    However, as of **October 10, 2025**, CWP does **not** pull CSF from our official repository and instead installs the **legacy v15.00** release.

    To get the most recent version from our repository, you’ll need to perform a **manual upgrade**.

    Instructions for doing so are provided below.

    If you would like to see CSF's latest version supported, [reach out to CentOS Web Panel](https://centos-webpanel.com/contact) and let them know.

Installing CSF with CWP integration is fairly straight-forward, with a few things to note. When installing CWP, they automatically install a copy of CSF as a bundle to your server. However, after this repository took over development; you will need to perform a manual upgrade if you want to utilize the latest version.

If this changes, we'll keep you updated.

<br />

Log in as the `root` user via SSH.

=== ":aetherx-axs-key: Using Password"

    ```shell
    ssh -vvv root@XX.XX.XX.XX -p 22
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file: Using Private Key"

    ```shell
    ssh -i /path/to/private_key -vvv root@XX.XX.XX.XX -p 22
    ```

<br />

Ensure you have CWP installed. If not, we need to prepare the server by performing some updates.

=== ":aetherx-axb-centos: CentOS 7"

    ```bash
    sudo yum -y install wget
    curl http://centos-webpanel.com/centos7_fix_repository|sudo sh
    sudo yum -y update
    reboot
    ```
  
=== ":aetherx-axs-8: CentOS 8/Alma/Rocky"

    ```bash
    sudo yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
    sudo dnf install wget -y
    sudo yum -y update
    reboot
    ```

<br />

Once your server is back online, you can proceed with the installation of CWP:

=== ":aetherx-axb-centos: CentOS 7"

    ```bash
    cd /usr/local/src
    wget http://centos-webpanel.com/cwp-el7-latest
    sh cwp-el7-latest
    ```
  
=== ":aetherx-axs-8: CentOS 8/Alma/Rocky (recommended)"

    ```bash
    cd /usr/local/src
    wget http://centos-webpanel.com/cwp-el8-latest
    sh cwp-el8-latest
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-9: CentOS 9/Alma 9/Rocky 9 (beta)"

    ```bash
    cd /usr/local/src
    wget http://centos-webpanel.com/cwp-el9-latest
    sh cwp-el9-latest
    ```

<br />

At the end of the installation, you can now access the CWP dashboard by opening your browser and going to the URL:

- `https://127.0.0.1:2031`

<br />

You should be greeted with the CWP authentication page. Provide a valid system username and password.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![CWP › Login Screen](../assets/images/install/cwp/1.png){ width="700" }
    <figcaption>CWP › Login Screen</figcaption>
</figure>

<br />

After signing in, you should be presented with the CWP dashboard:

<figure markdown="span">
    ![CWP › Dashboard](../assets/images/install/cwp/2.png){ width="700" }
    <figcaption>CWP › Dashboard</figcaption>
</figure>

<br />

When CWP is installed, it automatically includes CSF along with other essential packages required for proper functionality. However, at the time of writing, CWP does **not** bundle the latest version of CSF from this repository.  

Instead, you will receive version **`v15.00`**, which is downloaded from the following external source:

- [http://static.cdn-cwp.com/files/csf.tgz](http://static.cdn-cwp.com/files/csf.tgz)

<br />

If you wish to use the latest copy of CSF from our repository, you'll have to perform an update by downloading the latest copy of CSF from us, and installing it over-top of the original.

<br />

To do this, set aside CWP for a moment; we need to make sure that we don't have any existing firewalls that need disabled. If so, run the commands below:

=== ":aetherx-axs-block-brick-fire: UFW"

    Stop and disable `ufw`

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop ufw
    sudo systemctl disable ufw
    ```

    Confirm `ufw` is disabled with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status ufw
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-block-brick-fire: Firewalld"

    Stop and disable `firewalld`

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop firewalld
    sudo systemctl disable firewalld
    ```

    Confirm `firewalld` is disabled with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status firewalld
    ```

<br />

We are ready to install or update CSF, which you should already have downloaded to your system. If not; download the latest version of CSF:

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zipper: .tgz"

    ```shell
    # Using wget (tgz)
    wget https://download.configserver.dev/csf.tgz

    # Using curl (tgz)
    curl -O https://download.configserver.dev/csf.tgz
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zip: .zip"

    ```shell
    # Using wget (zip)
    wget https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip

    # Using curl (zip)
    curl -O https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip
    ```

<br />

Decompress / unzip the downloaded archive file:

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zipper: .tgz"

    ```bash
    tar -xzf csf.tgz -C /tmp
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axs-file-zip: .zip"

    ```bash
    unzip csf.zip -d /tmp
    ```

<br />

Run the CSF installation script:

=== ":aetherx-axd-circle-1: Option 1"

    :aetherx-axd-circle-1: Runs `install.sh` :aetherx-axd-dot: uses `sh` shell :aetherx-axd-dot: executable permission not required

    ```bash
    sudo sh /tmp/csf/install.sh
    ```

=== ":aetherx-axd-circle-2: Option 2"

    :aetherx-axd-circle-2: Runs `install.sh` :aetherx-axd-dot: uses shebang interpreter :aetherx-axd-dot: requires executable `+x` permission

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /tmp/csf/install.sh
    sudo /tmp/csf/install.sh
    ```

<br />

Follow any instructions on-screen. If prompted for any additional information, enter it.

<br />

Log back into CWP. Once in, navigate to **Security** › **CSF Firewall** from the left-hand menu.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![CWP › Security › CSF Firewall](../assets/images/install/cwp/4.png){ width="700" }
    <figcaption>CWP › Security › CSF Firewall</figcaption>
</figure>

<br />

If the interface matches the screenshot above, the CSF integration with CWP is complete.  

You can now proceed to the [Next Steps](#next-steps) or skip the rest of this section and begin our [Configuration](../usage/configuration.md) chapter to get things set up.

## Installer File Summary

This section provides a list of the installer scripts included with CSF and what their role plays in the installation process. This is available within our docs for more advanced users who wish to understand the process.

The installation process for CSF is handled through a main script that triggers several sub-installer scripts.  
You will run the `install.sh` script, which automatically detects your platform and then executes the appropriate sub-script.  

Each sub-script follows the naming scheme `install.<PLATFORM>.sh`. We have provided a list of the files below:

| File                            | Requires                              | Platform                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `install.sh`                    |                                       | Main installer script, detects your platform and re-reroutes your installation request to the correct installer sub-script listed below   |
| `install.generic.sh`            |                                       | Baremetal                                                                                                                                 |

| `install.cwp.sh`                | `/usr/local/cwpsrv`                   | CentOS Web Panel (CWP)                                                                                                                    |
| `install.cyberpanel.sh`         | `/usr/local/CyberCP`                  | CyberPanel                                                                                                                                |

| `install.vesta.sh`              | `/usr/local/vesta`                    | VestaCP                                                                                                                                   |

<br />

### install.sh

The `install.sh` script serves as a launcher that directs you to the appropriate installation script for your platform. It can be run on any system, automatically detects your environment, and executes the correct installer from the files listed above. Before running it, make sure the script is executable by running `chmod +x install.sh`. We’ll cover this in the steps below.

<br />

### install.generic.sh

This is the generic bare-metal installer for CSF. You should use this script when installing CSF on a server that does not have WHM, cPanel, DirectAdmin, or other control panels installed. If you run `install.sh`  and it does not detect any supported control panels, it will automatically start `install.generic.sh` to begin the installation.

<br />

### install.cpanel.sh


The `install.cpanel.sh` script is ran in order to integrate CSF with an existing cPanel/WHM installation. This file triggers if you run `install.sh`, which checks to see if your server has the file `/usr/local/cpanel/version`. 

<br />

### install.cwp.sh


The `install.cwp.sh` script is ran in order to integrate CSF with an existing copy of [CentOS Web Panel (CWP)](https://centos-webpanel.com/). This file triggers when you run `install.sh`, which checks to see if your server has the file `/usr/local/cwpsrv`.

<br />

### install.cyberpanel.sh


The `install.cyberpanel.sh` script is ran in order to integrate CSF with an existing copy of [Cyber Panel](https://cyberpanel.net/). This file triggers when you run `install.sh`, which checks to see if your server has the file `/usr/local/CyberCP`.

<br />

### install.directadmin.sh

The `install.directadmin.sh` script is ran in order to integrate CSF with an existing copy of [DirectAdmin](https://directadmin.com/). This file triggers when you run `install.sh`, which checks to see if your server has the file `/usr/local/directadmin/directadmin`.

<br />

### install.interworx.sh


The `install.interworx.sh` script is ran in order to integrate CSF with an existing copy of [InterWorx](https://interworx.com/). This file triggers when you run `install.sh`, which checks to see if your server has the file `/usr/local/interworx`.

<br />

### install.vesta.sh


The `install.vesta.sh` script is ran in order to integrate CSF with an existing copy of [VestaCP](https://vestacp.com/). This file triggers when you run `install.sh`, which checks to see if your server has the file `/usr/local/vesta`.

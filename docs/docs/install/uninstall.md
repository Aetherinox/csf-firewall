## Uninstall

If you have decided that you'd like to part ways with CSF, uninstalling the application is extremely easy as it only requires you to run the uninstall. First, make sure you set the uninstall script to be executable:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ``` shell
      sudo chmod +x /etc/csf/uninstall.sh
      ```

<br />

Then run the uninstall script itself:

=== ":aetherx-axd-command: Command"

      ``` shell
      sudo sh uninstall.sh
      ```

<br />

This will perform a series of actions including:

- :aetherx-axs-ban:{ .icon-clr-red } Stop and unregister the services `csf.service` and `lfd.service`
- :aetherx-axd-trash:{ .icon-clr-red } Delete the service files within `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`

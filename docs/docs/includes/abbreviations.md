*[Entrypoints]: In Traefik, entrypoints define where and how incoming requests arrive at the proxy (e.g., <code>:80</code> for HTTP or <code>:443</code> for HTTPS). They bind Traefik to specific ports/protocols and are the starting point for routing traffic into the system.

*[routers]: In Traefik, routers match incoming requests (from entrypoints) to the correct service. They evaluate rules (like hostnames, paths, headers) and then forward the traffic to the appropriate service, optionally applying middlewares along the way.

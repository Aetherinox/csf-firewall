## About Us

:aetherx-axs-csf-logo-1: **ConfigServer Firewall & Security** _(CSF)_ is a comprehensive security solution for Linux servers that functions as a **Stateful Packet Inspection** (SPI) firewall and intrusion detection system. 

Originally released in 2005, CSF acts as a front-end for iptables or nftables, allowing you to configure firewall rules in a way that protects your server from unauthorized access while permitting legitimate traffic. With CSF, you can safely manage access to services such as SSH, FTP, email, and web applications, while minimizing the risk of attacks from malicious IP addresses.

Included with CSF is the Login Failure Daemon (LFD), which continuously monitors server authentication logs for signs of brute-force attacks or repeated login failures. When suspicious activity is detected from a particular IP, LFD can automatically block that IP temporarily or indefinitely, preventing further attempts to compromise your server. This automated protection helps reduce the risk of account compromises and ensures that attacks are mitigated without requiring constant manual intervention.

Overall, CSF provides a balance of advanced security and ease of use. It gives server administrators a powerful interface for managing firewall rules, monitoring suspicious activity, and protecting servers from both external attacks and internal misconfigurations. By implementing CSF and LFD together, users can enhance their server’s security posture while maintaining the accessibility and functionality needed for everyday operations.

## Documentation

This documentation is designed to guide you through every aspect of using ConfigServer Firewall (CSF) on your server, from installation to advanced configuration. You’ll learn how to integrate CSF with popular tools like Traefik and Authentik, allowing for seamless reverse proxy setups and authentication management. The guide also covers how to configure CSF for the first time, including essential settings that ensure your server is secure out of the box.

We will dive into IPSET integration, explaining how to leverage kernel-managed sets to efficiently handle large blocklists. You’ll see how to manage third-party blocklists, which can automatically block known malicious IP addresses and ranges, helping you maintain a strong security posture with minimal manual effort.

Additionally, the documentation explores custom scripts and patches that extend CSF’s functionality. These scripts allow you to pre-configure iptable rules for common services like Docker and OpenVPN, providing an easy way to secure your server without needing to manually write complex firewall rules. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a thorough understanding of CSF’s capabilities and how to customize it for your server’s specific needs.

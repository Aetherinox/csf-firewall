# Privacy Policy

Your privacy and data security are of the utmost importance to us.  

This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information ConfigServer Security & Firewall (“**CSF**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, or “**us**”) collects, how that information is used, and the steps we take to safeguard it.  

By using our website, services, or participating in the **Insiders Program**, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described in this policy.  

In addition to this Privacy Policy, your use of our services is governed by our **ConfigServer Services Terms and Conditions** and any applicable **License Terms and Conditions** (available on each product’s page).

<br />

## 2. Information We Collect and Retain

When visiting our [documentation site](https://docs.configserver.dev) or participating in our **[Insiders Program](https://docs.configserver.dev/insiders)**, certain information may be collected under limited and clearly defined circumstances.

<br />

### A. General Website Usage

Our main website and associated subdomains do **not** actively collect or store any personal information.

We do not track user activity, browser fingerprints, or connection metadata.  

<br />

### B. Documentation Subdomain

Our [documentation](https://docs.configserver.dev) site uses a third-party framework called [**MkDocs**](https://mkdocs.org/), along with the **[Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material)** theme, which may store local cookies in your browser.  

When you first visit our documentation site, MkDocs will prompt you to **consent to cookies** before any optional or analytics-related cookies are set. This ensures compliance with data privacy regulations such as the GDPR.  

The cookies used are **strictly functional** and are limited to the following purposes:

- Remembering your selected display theme (e.g., light or dark mode)
- Retaining your navigation state, such as your last visited page
- Analytics (currently disabled) [^1]

We do **not** use cookies for advertising, behavioral tracking, or any form of user profiling.


<br />

### C. Insiders Program Participation

When you join the **[Insiders Program](https://docs.configserver.dev/insiders)**, limited personal information is collected to manage and verify your membership and licensing status.

Depending on the method of participation or donation, we may collect:

- Your **GitHub username**
  - Used to publically broadcast sponsors on our [Sponsors](https://docs.configserver.dev/insiders/sponsors/) page
- Your **Discord user ID**
  - Used give Insiders special perks and a role on our [Discord](https://discord.configserver.dev) server
- Your **email address** (if provided during signup or donation)
  - Used as a backup communication method
- The **timestamp of your sponsorship** with our licensing server
- The **timestamp of your last communication** with our licensing server

This information is used exclusively for program administration, including license validation, member communication, and early-release access.

<br />

### D. Cloud Services

We make use of third-party cloud infrastructure providers, such as **Cloudflare**, to enhance the security, performance, and reliability of our web services.  

These providers may automatically collect limited connection-related information — such as your IP address, browser type, and general request metadata — for purposes including threat detection, caching, load balancing, and protection against abuse or excessive request rates.  

Your IP address may be temporarily examined at the time of connection to detect suspicious activity or enforce rate limits. This process is automated and used solely to maintain service integrity.  

All data collection related to these operations is handled by the third-party service and is subject to their respective privacy policies.

We do **not** store or log this information within our own infrastructure beyond what is necessary for normal server operation.

<br />

### E. Data Retention

Information associated with the Insiders Program is retained for the duration of your active membership and may be archived for up to **90 days** following termination, to ensure continuity of support or compliance with auditing requirements.

After this period, the data is permanently deleted or anonymized.

## 3. Insiders Program and License Server

Participation in the **Insiders Program** requires connection to our license server for verification.

The license server collects and processes limited user data for the purpose of:

- Validating active licenses and Insiders status  
- Managing software release eligibility  
- Application updates  

This data is **not** used for analytics or shared with any external parties except as required for essential operation (for example, communication between CSF systems and GitHub for identity verification).

We do **not** sell, rent, or trade any personal data with third parties.

Access to stored information is strictly limited to authorized personnel for administrative purposes.

<br />

<br />

## 4. Third-Party Services

We utilize a minimal number of third-party services, each serving a specific operational purpose. These may include:

- **MkDocs** — Used solely for documentation.  
- **GitHub** — Used for hosting source code, managing issues/support tickets.  
- **Payment Processors** — Used for processing sponsorships or donations tied to Insiders membership, which may include:  
    - GitHub Sponsors  
    - PayPal  
    - BuyMeACoffee  
- **Cloudflare** — Provides network security, caching, and DDoS protection for our websites and services. Cloudflare may temporarily process connection-related data (such as IP addresses and request metadata) to detect abuse, manage traffic, and ensure reliable service delivery.
- **Discord** — Used for community support and communication. Discord may store information including your Discord username, ID, and any messages or interactions you have within our official CSF servers.

<br />

Each third-party service is responsible for its own privacy policy and compliance with applicable data protection regulations.

We recommend reviewing those providers’ respective privacy notices before using their platforms.

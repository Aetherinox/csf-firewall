## Personal Information

Our contribution platforms, including [BuyMeACoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/aetherinox) and [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Aetherinox), only share minimal information about sponsors with us. Consequently, we see limited information about the details of our sponsors.

The data we receive is restricted to basic information such as your username, email address, transaction ID, and contribution amount. We do not have access to any sensitive payment information, including credit card numbers or personal addresses.

## Refunds and Support

We do not have access to detailed information about individual sponsorship transactions, as [BuyMeACoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/aetherinox) and [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Aetherinox) do not share these details with us.  

For any questions regarding payments, refunds, or other sponsorship-related concerns, please contact the support team of the contribution gateway you used to make your contribution.

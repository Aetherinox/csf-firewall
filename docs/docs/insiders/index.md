## About

The ConfigServer Security & Firewall <!-- md:sponsor --> **Insiders Program** is for users who want to help support and shape the future of ConfigServer Security & Firewall. As an Insider, you’ll gain early access to upcoming features and experimental functionality before it is released to the public.

We don’t believe in putting security behind a paywall, because your safety shouldn’t depend on your wallet. The Insiders Program gives people a way to contribute to CSF by testing upcoming versions, keeping our lights on, and helping us catch bugs before a release rolls out to the public channel.

If you’ve got ideas on how something could work better or make life easier for others, your input can actually help steer where CSF goes next.

By sponsoring our project, you will receive the following:

- Insiders access to ConfigServer Security and Firewall release channel
- [Discord](https://discord.configserver.dev) <!-- md:sponsor --> **Sponsor** role
- Listed on our project [Sponsor](../insiders/sponsors.md) page
- Tell us additional perks you'd like to see as a Sponsor

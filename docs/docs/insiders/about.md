## About

The ConfigServer Security & Firewall <!-- md:sponsor --> **Insiders Program** is designed for users who want to actively support and help shape the future of CSF. As an Insider, you gain **early access** to upcoming features and experimental functionality before they are released to the public.

We believe that security should never be restricted by paywalls — your protection should not depend on your wallet. The Insiders Program is **not** about giving special features to a select few. Instead, it provides an opportunity to contribute by testing new versions, supporting the project, and helping identify bugs before public release. Ultimately, everyone receives the same application.

Even if you cannot contribute financially, that’s completely fine. You will still have access to the same security features as our Insiders, and our apps will remain fully open-source.

Your feedback is valuable. Any suggestions or ideas you have for improvements can directly shape the future development of CSF and make it easier for everyone to use.

## How It Helps

Sponsoring our work helps keep the gears turning (and the coffee flowing). Your support covers the real-world costs that come with running and improving CSF, including:

- Licenses for cPanel, Interworx, and any other control panels that require a license in the future
- Servers to host our websites, services, and the occasional experimental chaos  
- Additional resources and request limits for Cloudflare Workers (and other Cloudflare services)
- Paid tools that help us debug, test, and keep things from catching fire  
- Coffee — **lots** of coffee. _(Seriously, without it, the entire operation would grind to a halt.)_

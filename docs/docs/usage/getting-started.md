# Usage › Getting Started

In the previous [Installation](../install/dependencies.md) chapter, we covered how to install both the depenencies and **ConfigServer Firewall & Security (CSF)** itself on your server. This chapter covers the fundamentals of configuring CSF and understanding how it operates. 

If you are looking for straight-forward information such as commands, folder and file structure, or configuration examples, check out the [Cheatsheet](./cheatsheet/home.md) guides listed below.

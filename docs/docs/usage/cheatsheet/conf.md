# Cheatsheet: Example Configs <!-- omit from toc -->

Two versions of the config file have been provided below. A **full version** which contains comments, and a **clean version** which contains no comments and only the config settings. 

You may copy the contents, and place it within your server under the path `/etc/csf/csf.conf`.

- [Full Version](#full-version)
- [Clean Version](#clean-version)

<br />

After you have set your config file to its desired values; you must restart the CSF service to apply the configurations. Open Terminal and run:

```shell
sudo csf -r
```

<br />

You can also restart both CSF and LFD services with `-ra, --restartall`

```shell
sudo csf -ra
```

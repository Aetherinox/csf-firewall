# Troubleshooting

This chapter breaks down each supported control panel into its own sub-chapter, while also including a section on generic CSF installation and usage.  

It highlights some of the most common issues, questions, and errors users may encounter when using CSF, and provides practical solutions to address them.

The control panels covered include:

- cPanel/WHM
- CWP (CentOS Web Panel)
- [CyberPanel](cyberpanel.md)
- DirectAdmin
- InterWorx
- VestaCP

Additionally, a **Generic Issues** section is provided to cover topics and solutions relevant to CSF itself, independent of any control panel integration.

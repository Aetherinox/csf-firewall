# Usage ‚Ä∫ Pre and Post Scripts

CSF provides special folders where you can place your own bash scripts to be executed at specific points during the firewall startup process. These scripts make it easy to maintain custom, persistent firewall rules that are automatically applied every time the CSF service is restarted.

<br />

---

<br />

## Location and Structure

This section outlines exactly how the pre and post scriptsare initialized and loaded.

<br />

### Loader Scripts

When CSF is installed for the first time, two loader files are added to your system. These files are described below:

:aetherx-axd-file: <!-- md:option /usr/local/csf/bin/csfpre.sh -->

:   - This file is responsible for iterating over your `/usr/local/include/csf/pre.d/` folder and loading any scripts located in that directory.
    - Runs **before** any iptables rules are added by CSF, allowing you to prepare the environment or add rules that must exist prior to CSF‚Äôs standard rules.

:aetherx-axd-file: <!-- md:option /usr/local/csf/bin/csfpost.sh -->

:   - This file is responsible for iterating over your `/usr/local/include/csf/post.d/` folder and loading any scripts located in that directory.
    - Runs **after** all iptables rules are applied, letting you append custom rules that should persist alongside CSF's configuration. 

<br />

### Loader Folders

When the [loader scripts](#loader-scripts) above are run, they will scan their respective folders. These folders are where you should place your custom scripts, allowing you to create persistent firewall rules that are automatically applied each time CSF starts or restarts.

:aetherx-axd-folder: <!-- md:option /usr/local/include/csf/pre.d/ -->

:   - Stores scripts that are executed **before** CSF applies its default iptables rules.
    - Any scripts placed in this folder will run automatically every time CSF is started or restarted, allowing you to configure custom rules or settings prior to CSF‚Äôs standard firewall rules.
    - Files in this folder are initialized and loaded by the script `/usr/local/csf/bin/csfpre.sh`

:aetherx-axd-folder: <!-- md:option /usr/local/include/csf/post.d/ -->

:   - Stores scripts that are executed **after** CSF applies its default iptables rules.
    - Any scripts placed in this folder will run automatically every time CSF is started or restarted, allowing you to configure custom rules or settings after to CSF‚Äôs standard firewall rules.
    - Files in this folder are initialized and loaded by script `/usr/local/csf/bin/csfpost.sh`

<br />

We have provided an example structure of how your scripts should be stored. When creating your script files, they can be any name you want.

```
üìÅ usr
   üìÅ local
      üìÅ csf
         üìÅ bin
            üìÑ csfpre.sh
            üìÑ csfpost.sh
      üìÅ include
         üìÅ csf
            üìÅ pre.d
               üìÑ my_rules_before.sh
            üìÅ post.d
               üìÑ my_docker_rules.sh
               üìÑ openvpn_rules.sh
```

## Essential Config Properties

This section outlines some of the most important settings that you may want to review. Each one is listed below:

<br />

### TESTING

<!-- md:flag required --> <!-- md:file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aetherinox/csf-firewall/main/extras/example_configs/etc/csf/csf.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aetherinox/csf-firewall/main/extras/example_configs/etc/csf/csf.conf --> <!-- md:source /etc/csf/csf.conf --> <!-- md:default `1` -->

<br />

Testing mode is a feature built into CSF and LFD which does the following when enabled:

- Allows safe configuration of CSF without enforcing firewall rules or banning IPs.
- Reads configuration files like `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to detect service ports. Detected ports (SSH, IPv6, TCP/UDP) are added to CSF config variables such as `TCP_IN`, `TCP6_IN`, `UDP_IN` in `/etc/csf/csf.conf`.
- LFD does not run as a daemon.
- Adds a cron job to periodically reload CSF rules for testing, but no actual blocking occurs.
- IPs in `csf.allow` and `csf.deny` are processed for testing but **not enforced**.
- Displays currently listening ports to sysadmin; helps safely configure CSF before enabling enforcement.

```ini
# #
#   Testing flag - enables a CRON job that clears iptables incase of
#   configuration problems when you start csf. This should be enabled until you
#   are sure that the firewall works - i.e. incase you get locked out of your
#   server! Then do remember to set it to 0 and restart csf when you're sure
#   everything is OK. Stopping csf will remove the line from /etc/crontab
#   
#   lfd will not start while this is enabled
# #

TESTING = "0"
```

<br />
<br />

### TCP_IN, TCP_OUT

### DENY_IP_LIMIT

<!-- md:flag required --> <!-- md:fileDownload https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aetherinox/csf-firewall/main/extras/example_configs/etc/csf/csf.conf --> <!-- md:source /etc/csf/csf.conf --> <!-- md:default `200` -->

<br />

This setting controls the **maximum number of IP addresses** that can be listed in the `/etc/csf/csf.deny` file. You can increase or decrease this limit depending on your server‚Äôs needs.  

Keep in mind that raising the limit on servers with low memory (such as Virtuozzo or OpenVZ) may cause network slowdowns if thousands of rules are loaded.  

When the limit is reached, CSF will automatically rotate the entries; meaning that the oldest entries (at the top of the file) are removed, and the newest ones are added. This check only happens when using `csf -d`, which is also what `lfd` relies on. Setting this value to `0` disables the limit entirely.  

If you need to allow a much larger number of blocked IPs or CIDRs, it‚Äôs recommended to use CSF's [IPSETs](../usage/ipset.md) integration instead for better performance.

``` cfg
# #
#   Limit the number of IP's kept in the /etc/csf/csf.deny file
#   
#   Care should be taken when increasing this value on servers with low memory
#   resources or hard limits (such as Virtuozzo/OpenVZ) as too many rules (in the
#   thousands) can sometimes cause network slowdown
#   
#   The value set here is the maximum number of IPs/CIDRs allowed
#   if the limit is reached, the entries will be rotated so that the oldest
#   entries (i.e. the ones at the top) will be removed and the latest is added.
#   The limit is only checked when using csf -d (which is what lfd also uses)
#   Set to 0 to disable limiting
#   
#   For implementations wishing to set this value significantly higher, we
#   recommend using the IPSET option
# #

DENY_IP_LIMIT = "200"
```

<br />
<br />

### CT_LIMIT

<!-- md:flag required --> <!-- md:fileDownload https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aetherinox/csf-firewall/main/extras/example_configs/etc/csf/csf.conf --> <!-- md:source /etc/csf/csf.conf --> <!-- md:default `0` -->

<br />

**Connection Tracking** lets the firewall keep track of how many connections each IP address makes to your server. If an IP opens more connections than the set limit, it will be automatically blocked. This can help protect against certain types of DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.  

Be cautious when enabling this option. Some services like **FTP**, **IMAP**, and **HTTP** naturally create many connections, including ones left in `TIME_WAIT`, which can lead to false positives. On busy servers, it‚Äôs easy for legitimate traffic to hit the limit. For servers at higher risk of DoS attacks, however, this feature can be very useful. A practical starting value is usually around `300` connections.

To disable this feature, set this to 0

```ini
# #
#   Connection Tracking. This option enables tracking of all connections from IP
#   addresses to the server. If the total number of connections is greater than
#   this value then the offending IP address is blocked. This can be used to help
#   prevent some types of DOS attack.
#
#   Care should be taken with this option. It's entirely possible that you will
#   see false-positives. Some protocols can be connection hungry, e.g. FTP, IMAPD
#   and HTTP so it could be quite easy to trigger, especially with a lot of
#   closed connections in TIME_WAIT. However, for a server that is prone to DOS
#   attacks this may be very useful. A reasonable setting for this option might
#   be around 300.
#   
#   To disable this feature, set this to 0
# #

CT_LIMIT = "0"
```

    Improve firewall efficiency in CSF by enabling IPSET integration to manage
    large blocklists.  

    This chapter covers installing the IPSET package and configuring CSF to use
    it for handling blocklists.  

    Using IPSET allows CSF to group IP addresses into sets, reducing the number
    of iptables rules and improving overall performance.

    Blocklists in CSF allow you to automatically block connections from known
    malicious IP addresses, helping to protect your server from abusive traffic.  

    This chapter explains how to configure and use blocklists, including CSF‚Äôs
    official blocklist and third-party sources.  

    You‚Äôll also learn how to enable blocklists with or without IPSET, ensuring
    they work efficiently no matter the size of the list.

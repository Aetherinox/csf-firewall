## Summary

ConfigServer Firewall & Security, also known as CSF, is a Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI) firewall and Login/Intrusion Detection and Security application for Linux servers which started back in 2005. CSF works as a front-end to iptables or nftables, configuring your server‚Äôs firewall rules to lock down public access to services while allowing only approved connections.

This provides better security for your server while giving you an advanced, easy-to-use interface for managing firewall settings. With CSF in place, you can safely permit activities such as logging in via FTP or SSH, checking email, and loading websites, while unauthorized access attempts are blocked.

<br />

> [!NOTE] 
> In August 2025, the original developer, Way to the Web Ltd, discontinued development of ConfigServer Firewall. This repository has since taken over, continuing its development by adding new features and providing ongoing bug fixes.

## Install

This section will explain how to install ConfigServer Firewall in very simple terms, without a lot of extra detail. We also provide a full and detailed [Installation Guide](https://aetherinox.github.io/csf-firewall/install/dependencies/) within our official documentation. These docs go into much more detail than our README. However, if you're looking for a quick setup, read below:

<br />

### Requirements

Installing CSF on your server requires the following:

- Linux server running `CentOS`, `Debian`, `Ubuntu`, or any other compatible Linux distribution. 
- Root access or user account with `sudo` privileges.
- `Perl` installed on your server.

<br />

### Install

Use these instructions if you wish to manually install CSF on your server. 

<br />

#### Step 1: Dependencies

To install the latest version of CSF manually, run the following commands:

<br />

  - For **Debian/Ubuntu**:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
      perl \
      libwww-perl \
      libio-socket-ssl-perl \
      libcrypt-ssleay-perl \
      libnet-libidn-perl \
      libio-socket-inet6-perl \
      libsocket6-perl \
      ipset
    ```

<br />

  - For **CentOS/RHEL**:

    ```shell
    sudo yum makecache && sudo yum install -y \
      perl \
      perl-libwww-perl \
      perl-IO-Socket-SSL \
      perl-Net-SSLeay \
      perl-Net-LibIDN \
      perl-IO-Socket-INET6 \
      perl-Socket6 \
      ipsets
    ```

<br />
<br />
<br />

#### Step 2: Download

To download and install CSF, you have two options. Both options give you the latest version of our CSF archive. 

1. [Download .zip using wget or curl](#download-direct)
2. [Download .zip using get.sh script](#download-getsh)

<br />

##### Download Direct

To download the latest CSF release, run one of the commands:

```shell
# Using wget
wget https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip

# Using curl
curl -O https://download.configserver.dev/csf.zip
```

<br />

##### Download Get.sh

To download the latest version of CSF using our [get.sh](https://get.configserver.dev) script, run one of the commands below. This will simply give you the zip file in the folder you run the command from.

```shell
# Using wget
bash <(wget -qO - https://get.configserver.dev) && . ~/.bashrc

# Using curl
bash <(curl -sL https://get.configserver.dev) && . ~/.bashrc
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

The CSF archive should be on your server; extract it to a subfolder called `./csf`:

```shell
# .zip filename
unzip -oq "csf.zip" -d "csf"

# .tgz filename
tar -xzf "csf.tgz" -C "csf"
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

#### Step 3: Run Pre-install Tests

Before enabling and configuring CSF, it is crucial to test whether it is compatible with your server. Run the following command to initiate the test. 

If the test completes successfully, you will see `RESULT: csf should function on this server`. If there are any problems, the test will provide information on how to resolve them.

```shell
sudo perl csf/csftest.pl
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

#### Step 4: Install

After completing [Step 3: Run Pre-install Tests](#step-3-run-pre-install-tests), Navigate to the extracted directory:

```shell
cd csf
```

<br />

Run the installation script. After installation, you must [Disable Testing Mode](#step-5-disable-testing-mode).

```shell
sudo sh install.sh
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

#### Step 5: Disable Testing Mode

In order for the LFD service to be started, you must disable `TESTING` mode. Open your csf config file at `/etc/csf/csf.conf` and change `TESTING = "1"` to `0`.

```shell
TESTING = "0"
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

#### Step 6: Enable and Start Services

After doing all of the above, confirm that CSF and LFD are now running on your server. First, we will enable CSF with the following command:

```shell
sudo csf --enable
```

<br />

Then start the service:

```shell
sudo systemctl start csf
sudo systemctl start lfd
sudo csf -ra
```

<br />

Confirm that the CSF service is up and running:

```shell
sudo systemctl status csf
```

<br />

You should see:

```shell
‚óè csf.service - ConfigServer Firewall & Security - csf
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/csf.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
    Active: active (exited) since Sun 2025-09-21 01:35:45 UTC; 4s ago
    Process: 449564 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/csf --initup (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
  Main PID: 449564 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
        CPU: 621ms
```

<br />

Now check the LFD service for the same status:

```shell
sudo systemctl status lfd
```

<br />

You should see:

```shell
‚óè lfd.service - ConfigServer Firewall & Security - lfd
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/lfd.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
    Active: active (running) since Sun 2025-09-21 01:44:00 UTC; 53min ago
    Process: 335736 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/lfd (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
  Main PID: 335770 (lfd - sleeping)
      Tasks: 1 (limit: 4546)
    Memory: 39.2M (peak: 63.3M)
        CPU: 15.090s
    CGroup: /system.slice/lfd.service
            ‚îî‚îÄ335770 "lfd - sleeping"
```

<br />

At this point, CSF and LFD should be up and running, with minimal configuration. We highly recommend going to our official documentation for a more in-depth tutorial on how to install and configure CSF. These docs are available in our [Install Chapter](https://aetherinox.github.io/csf-firewall/install/dependencies/).

## IP Sets / Blocklist

CSF supports the use of blocklists to help protect your server from malicious IP addresses and unwanted network traffic. Blocklists are essentially collections of IPs or networks that are known to be associated with spammers, hackers, botnets, or other abusive behavior. When CSF is configured to use blocklists, it can automatically deny or restrict connections from these IPs, reducing the risk of compromise, brute-force attacks, and other forms of network abuse. By proactively filtering traffic, blocklists help maintain server security and improve overall system reliability.

Blocklists can come from a variety of third-party vendors, each maintaining their own lists based on threat intelligence and community reporting. Examples of well-known blocklist providers include Spamhaus, DShield, TOR Exit Node lists, BOGON networks, Project Honey Pot, and MaxMind‚Äôs anonymous proxies, among others. These lists are continuously updated and can be integrated into CSF to provide real-time protection against emerging threats.

In addition to third-party lists, CSF offers its own official blocklist and IPSET service, maintained in the Official CSF Repository
. Users can choose to use the CSF official blocklist alone or combine it with other vendors‚Äô lists for more comprehensive coverage. Using multiple blocklists in conjunction ensures a layered defense, helping administrators mitigate attacks and maintain control over who can access their server while minimizing false positives.

By leveraging blocklists, CSF empowers users to proactively defend their infrastructure, reduce malicious traffic, and maintain a more secure hosting environment without manual monitoring of each incoming IP.

<br />

### Official Blocklists

CSF hosts our own set of blocklists which are are automatically updated every `6 hours`. You may add these sets to your ConfigServer Firewall `/etc/csf/csf.blocklists` with the following new lines:

```
CSF_MASTER|43200|400000|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aetherinox/csf-firewall/main/blocklists/master.ipset
CSF_HIGHRISK|43200|0|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aetherinox/csf-firewall/main/blocklists/highrisk.ipset
```

<br />
<br />

#### Main Lists

These are the primary lists that most people will be interested in. They contain a large list of IP addresses which have been reported recently for abusive behavior. These statistics are gathered from numerous websites such as [AbuseIPDB](https://abuseipdb.com/) and [IPThreat](https://ipthreat.net/). IPs on this list have a 100% confidene level, which means you should get no false-positives from any of the IPs in these lists. IP addresses in these lists have been flagged for engaging in the following:

- SSH Bruteforcing
- Port Scanning
- DDoS Attacks
- IoT Targeting
- Phishing

<br />

For the majority of people, using the blocklists `master.ipset` and `highrisk.ipset` will be all you need. It is a massive collection, all with a 100% confidence level, which means you should get none or minimal false positives. 

<br />

| Set Name | Description | Severity | View |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `master.ipset` | <sub>Abusive IP addresses which have been reported for port scanning and SSH brute-forcing. HIGHLY recommended. <br> Includes [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/), [IPThreat](https://ipthreat.net/), [CinsScore](https://cinsscore.com), [GreensNow](https://blocklist.greensnow.co/greensnow.txt)</sub> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ | [view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aetherinox/csf-firewall/main/blocklists/master.ipset) |

## Notes

This section simply outlines notes about ConfigServer Firewall

<br />

### CSF to Iptable Commands

ConfigServer Firewall is a way to manage your existing firewall rules. In order for ConfigServer Firewall to work, your server must have the library `iptables` installed. ConfigServer Firewall is basically a wrapper for iptables, and has the additional option of adding a web UI so that you can visually manage your firewall instead of using commands. Without `iptables`, ConfigServer Firewall is useless.

<br />

If you were to uninstall ConfigServer Firewall from your server; you would still have the ability to do everything CSF can, but you would have to manually run commands on the package iptables. 

<br />

This section gives you the commands that ConfigServer Firewall uses to manage your firewall, and gives you the iptables alternative command if you do not wish to use CSF.

<br />
<br />

#### Default Policy

ConfigServer Firewall and iptables come with three main CHAINS. ConfigServer Firewall will set these three main chains to have the policy `DROP`. 

This `DROP` policy means that no connections are allowed to access any of these chains on your server, meaning nobody can connect to your server; unless you have added rules to allow access by an IP address or port. 

To set the policy of these chains; run:

```shell
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP 
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
```

<br />

You can select from the list of available policies. 

- `ACCEPT` Accepts packets into or out of your server.
- `DROP` Denies access to a port or server, but makes the connection appear to be to an unoccupied IP address. Scanners may choose not to continue scanning addresses which appear unoccupied.
- `REJECT` Denies access to a port or server, but tells the connecting party that the server and port are really there, but they've been denied access to transmit data or connect.

<br />

As a general rule:
  - Use `ACCEPT` to allow access to a port or IP by a connecting party.
  - Use `DROP` for connections to hosts you don't want people to see.
  - Use `REJECT` when you want the other end to know the port is unreachable.

<br />
<br />

#### Clear Iptables / Open Firewall

To clear every single iptables rule and open your firewall back up, run the following command. Note that this will completely turn off iptables / CSF's blocking abilities. Your server will be open to connections:

```shell
sudo iptables -F
sudo iptables -X
sudo iptables -t nat -F
sudo iptables -t nat -X
sudo iptables -t mangle -F
sudo iptables -t mangle -X
sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
```

<br />
<br />

#### List Rules

To list all of your iptable rules, and the rules that CSF has added to your firewall, run:

```shell
sudo iptables --list --line-numbers -n
```

<br />
<br />

#### List Chains

To list all of the chains in iptables, run:

```shell
sudo iptables -L | grep Chain
```

<br />

A list of the available CHAINS are provided below:

> [!NOTE]
> Out of box, ConfigServer Firewall & Iptables makes use of three chains
>   - `INPUT` Packets coming _from_ the network and going _to_ your server 
>   - `OUTPUT` Packets originating _from_ your server and going _to_ the network.
>   - `FORWARD` Packets forwarded by your server, if/when it acts as a router between different networks such as <sup> `DOCKER` </sup>
> 
> **Additional Chains**
>   - `NAT` This table is consulted when a packet that creates a new connection is encountered. It consists of four built-ins:
>     - `PREROUTING` for altering packets as soon as they come in
>     - `INPUT` for altering packets destined for local sockets
>     - `OUTPUT` for altering locally-generated packets before routing
>     - `POSTROUTING` for altering packets as they are about to go out
>   - `MANGLE` Used for specialized packet alteration.
>   - `DOCKER` Rules that determine whether a packet that is not part of an established connection should be accepted, based on the port forwarding configuration of running containers.
>   - `DOCKER-USER` A placeholder for user-defined rules that will be processed before rules in the <sup> `DOCKER-FORWARD` </sup> and <sup> `DOCKER` </sup> chains.
>   - `DOCKER-FORWARD` The first stage of processing for Docker's networks. Rules that pass packets that are not related to established connections to the other Docker chains, as well as rules to accept packets that are part of established connections.
>   - `DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE-1` Rules to isolate Docker networks from each other.
>   - `DOCKER-INGRESS` Rules related to Swarm networking.

<br />
<br />

#### Unblock Port

If you make use of the ConfigServer Firewall WebUI; one of the features available is the ability to whitelist / allow access to certain ports. If you do not wish to use the WebUI, you can unblock these ports in your terminal using `iptables`.

To access unblocking ports in CSF, open your WebUI:

<p align="center"><img style="width: 80%;text-align: center;" src="docs/images/readme/20.jpg"></p>

<br />

Select **Firewall Configuration**, and then scroll down until you see the settings:

- `TCP_IN`
- `TCP_OUT`

<br />

<p align="center"><img style="width: 80%;text-align: center;" src="docs/images/readme/21.jpg"></p>

<br />

To unblock a port using Iptables using the command that CSF would use, you can run the following. For this example, we will unblock port `43` which can be used for the `whois` package:

```shell
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT ! -o lo -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -p tcp --dport 43 -j ACCEPT
```

<br />

Remember to change `--dport 43` to the port you wish to unblock, change `-p tcp` to specify either `TCP` or `UDP`, and change `-D OUTPUT` to specify the chain you want the port to allow access through.

<br />

To re-block port `43` and disallow connections, delete the rule in iptables:

```shell
sudo iptables -D OUTPUT ! -o lo -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -p tcp --dport 43 -j ACCEPT
```

<br />

To view the firewall rule in your iptables, run:

```shell
sudo iptables --list --line-numbers -n
```

<br />

Running this command should output all your table rules. Your new rule will appear as:

```
Chain OUTPUT (policy DROP)
num  target     prot opt source               destination         
1    ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:43 ctstate NEW
```

<br />
<br />

#### Allow OpenVPN

To allow OpenVPN through CSF / Iptables, run the following command. Replace `tun0` with your channel adapter name.

```shell
TUN_ADAPTER=$(ip -br l | awk '$1 ~ "^tun[0-9]" { print $1}')
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -o ${TUN_ADAPTER} -j ACCEPT
```

<br />

Next, add a `POSTROUTING` rule. If you do not want to use your default adapter name, replace `${ETH_ADAPTER}` with the name. For ours, we will use `eth0`.

```shell
ETH_ADAPTER=$(ip route | grep default | sed -e "s/^.*dev.//" -e "s/.proto.*//")
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ${ETH_ADAPTER} -j MASQUERADE
```

<br />

Now we need to add a few rules for the IP block our OpenVPN server will use. In this example, we'll use `10.8.0.0/24`.

```shell
ETH_ADAPTER=$(ip route | grep default | sed -e "s/^.*dev.//" -e "s/.proto.*//")
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s "10.8.0.0/24" -o ${ETH_ADAPTER} -j MASQUERADE
```

<br />

Next, add the iptable rules for your OpenVPN server's port. Replace `1194` with your OpenVPN port if it is different. Replace `${ETH_ADAPTER}` with your desired ethernet adapter name if you do not wish to use the default defined below.

```shell
ETH_ADAPTER=$(ip route | grep default | sed -e "s/^.*dev.//" -e "s/.proto.*//")
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i ${ETH_ADAPTER} -m state --state NEW -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -o ${ETH_ADAPTER} -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i ${ETH_ADAPTER} -o tun+ -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
```

<br />

Finally, set the adapter name `tun+` to have access to the `OUTPUT` chain. 

The `+` symbol is a wildcard rule; which means that if you create multiple OpenVPN tunnels, they'll automatically be allowed through the OUTPUT chain, such as `tun1`, `tun2`, etc. If you only want one specific tunnel to be allowed, change `tun+` to `tun0`, or whatever tunnel you want to allow.

```shell
sudo iptables  -A OUTPUT -o tun+ -j ACCEPT
```

<br />

Your OpenVPN server should now be able to allow connections between CSF / Iptables and OpenVPN.

## Questions & Answers

Have a question? See if it's answered here:

<br />

<details>
<summary>I can't get the statistics button to show</summary>

<br />

In order to view statistics in CSF, you must ensure you do the following steps. First, enable the setting within `/etc/csf/csf.conf`:

```bash
ST_ENABLE = "1"
```

<br />

You can confirm the setting by running:

```shell
grep ST_ENABLE /etc/csf/csf.conf

# Should return:
ST_ENABLE = "1"
```

<br />

Next, ensure you have the `ServerStats` perl module installed:

```shell
ls -l /usr/local/csf/lib/ConfigServer/ServerStats.pm

# Should return:
-rw------- 1 root root 138268 Aug 25 08:46 /usr/local/csf/lib/ConfigServer/ServerStats.pm
```

<br />

Finally, ensure you installed the perl module `GD::Graph / GD`:

```shell
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install -y libgd-graph-perl libgd-perl

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install -y perl-GDGraph perl-GD
```

<br />

Then give CSF / LFD a restart:

```shell
sudo csf -ra
```

<br />

You can also run the following command to test the required module. If no errors pop up, then you should be able to run the statistics functionality without issues:

```shell
perl /usr/local/csf/lib/ConfigServer/ServerStats.pm
```

</details>

<br />

<details>
<summary>What other perl modules are required?</summary>

<br />

You can confirm the required perl modules by running in terminal:

```shell
# Core modules (usually installed, but included for completeness)
perl -MCPAN -e 'install strict'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install warnings'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install IO::Socket::INET'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Socket'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install File::Path'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install File::Basename'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install File::Copy'

```

<br />

Or if you‚Äôre on a Debian/Ubuntu system:

```shell
apt-get install -y perl libio-socket-ssl-perl libwww-perl libjson-perl libnet-ssleay-perl libcrypt-ssleay-perl
```

<br />

On CentOS/RHEL:

```shell
yum install -y perl perl-IO-Socket-SSL perl-libwww-perl perl-JSON perl-Net-SSLeay perl-Crypt-SSLeay
```

<br />

Or you can install using **CPAN**

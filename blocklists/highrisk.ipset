#   The IP addresses contained within this list are classified as the highest risk to your network
#   and have a possibility that the activity which comes from them are going to be fraudulent.
#
#   Users should always import this list into your firewall rules to ensure that these addresses
#   can never reach your network.
#
#   Several data-points are taken into consideration when generating this list, including the
#   IP addresses overall history in the last year, as well as how many times each IP address
#   has been reported to numerous online abuse reporting services.
#
#   After these points are obtained, the IP address is averaged against a master list to compare
#   the activity against all other IP addresses that have been reported over the last year.

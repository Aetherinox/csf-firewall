#   This list contains ip addresses associated with Amazon AWS servers.
#   
#   Amazon leases servers / products like hosted software and AI analytics to companies. Customers
#   can rent servers using the Amazon AWS service which allows them to pay a monthly fee to rent a
#   box they can utilize for whatever purpose.
#
#   Illegal activities are against Amazon's Terms of Service, however, it does happen. This blocklist
#   allows you to stop any communication between your server, and the Amazon AWS servers.
#
#   If you believe an Amazon AWS server is being used to attack you, file a report at:

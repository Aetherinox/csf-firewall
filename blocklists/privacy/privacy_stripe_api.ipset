#   Stripe API
#
#   Stripe is a payment service provider that lets merchants accept credit and debit cards or other payments.
#   Its payment processing solution, Stripe Payments, is best suited for businesses that make most of their
#   sales online, as most of its unique features are primarily geared toward online sales.
#
#   The Stripe REST API allows developers to integrate Stripe's payment functionalities into their applications.
#
#   This service is available via

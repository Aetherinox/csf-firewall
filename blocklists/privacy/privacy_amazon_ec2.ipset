#   This list contains ip addresses associated with Amazon EC2 servers.
#   
#   Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) allows for customers to rent and deploy a virtual
#   machine (vm) which can sometimes attempt to access your server.
#
#   Illegal activities are against Amazon's Terms of Service, however, it does happen. This
#   blocklist allows you to stop any communication between your server, and the Amazon EC2 servers.

#   Cloudflare is known as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) which offers a variety of tools which
#   allows you to speed up loading times of your website. Adding your domain to the Cloudflare CDN
#   means that your site becomes part of the Cloudflare network. This network routes web site
#   traffic through Cloudflare's global network of data centers. 
#   
#   Cloudflare optimizes web content delivery by storing duplicates of static content (such as CSS,
#   JavaScript and image files) on its servers. Your web site content is served from the Cloudflare
#   server located nearest to your visitors, which decreases page load times. If a server in
#   Cloudflare's network is very busy, web traffic is automatically routed to the next server nearest
#   to your visitors.

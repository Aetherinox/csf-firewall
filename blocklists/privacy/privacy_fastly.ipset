#   This list contains ip addresses associated with Fastly.
#
#   Fastly is classified as a "content delivery network" (CDN), much like Cloudflare. Fastly allows
#   you to cache / store content such as css, javascript, static pages, and other cachable
#   information within their servers.
#
#   This is not typically a service that you would wish to block from from your servers, as these
#   IP addresses do not scan ports, attempt ssh bruteforces, and are only used to deliver content
#   listed above.

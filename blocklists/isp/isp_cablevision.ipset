#   After Altice acquired Cablevision Systems Corporation on November 30, 2016, Suddenlink was combined with
#   Cablevision. Together with Optimum, the name used by Cablevision for its products, Altice USA became the
#   United States' fourth largest cable operator with 4.6 million subscribers, and the sixth largest Pay TV
#   service provider with 3.5 million subscribers. On August 1, 2022, Suddenlink rebranded into Optimum.
#
#   This blocklist contains mostly Cablevision IP addresses, however, it also includes some blocks which
#   carried over from the acquisition of Suddenlink and Optimum which are registered as the same ASN.

# The following is a list of Reseller accounts that you want to allow access to
# limited csf functionality.
#
# WARNING: You should only ever provide access to this facility to people you
# trust as it could easily render your server inaccessible or open to attack.
# For security reasons, resellers cannot list blocked IP addresses or the whole
# iptables configuration. They must know what IP address they want to use with
# this facility.
#
# You should list each account, one per line, followed by a colon, then a 0 or
# 1 depending on whether you want an email alert sent using the email template
# reselleralter.txt whenever an ALLOW/DENY or UNBLOCK is performed, then a
# colon, then a comma separated list of the feature codes that you want each
# reseller to have access to.
#
# As of writing, the following is a list of the available feature codes. More
# may be added in the feature, in which case they will be listed in the main
# csf readme.txt:
#
# USE        - The reseller can use this facility through WHM (required)
# UNBLOCK    - The reseller can use the Quick Unblock feature
# GREP       - The reseller can use the Search IP feature
# ALLOW      - The reseller can use the Quick Allow feature
# DENY       - The reseller can use the Quick Deny feature
#
# For example, to allow reseller "someuser" to unblock IP addresses and have an
# alert email sent to root, use:
#
#someuser:1:USE,UNBLOCK
#
# For example, to allow reseller "someuser" to allow, deny and unblock IP
# addresses, but no alert sent, use:
#
#someuser:0:USE,ALLOW,DENY,UNBLOCK
#
# RECOMMEND: For security reasons, we recommend only allowing resellers USE,
# UNBLOCK and GREP
#
# NOTE: As of version cPanel v11.8.1 you must additionally grant resellers
# access via "WHM > Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges > Third Party
# Services > ConfigServer Security & Firewall (Reseller UI)".

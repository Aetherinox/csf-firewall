# This file contains definitions to IP BLOCK lists.
#
# Uncomment the line starting with the rule name to use it, then restart csf
# and then lfd
#
# Each block list must be listed on per line: as NAME|INTERVAL|MAX|URL
#   NAME    : List name with all uppercase alphabetic characters with no
#             spaces and a maximum of 25 characters - this will be used as the
#             iptables chain name
#   INTERVAL: Refresh interval to download the list, must be a minimum of 3600
#             seconds (an hour), but 86400 (a day) should be more than enough
#   MAX     : This is the maximum number of IP addresses to use from the list,
#             a value of 0 means all IPs
#   URL     : The URL to download the list from
#
# Note: Some of these lists may be very long and could cause serious network
# and/or performance issues unless you are using LF_IPSET in csf, so setting a
# value for the MAX field should be considered
#
# After making any changes to this file you must restart csf and then lfd
#
# If you want to redownload a blocklist you must first delete
# /var/lib/csf/csf.block.NAME and then restart csf and then lfd
#
# Each URL is scanned for an IP/CIDR address per line and if found is blocked
#
# The downloaded list can be a zip file. The zip file MUST only contain a
# single text file of a single IP/CIDR per line
#
# Note: CXS_ is a reserved prefix for the blocklist name and MUST NOT be used

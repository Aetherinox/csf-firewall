#   List IP addresses here to allow them through iptables. Use one IP
#   address per line.  
#    
#   CIDR notation is supported. eg:  
#       192.168.254.0/24  
#    
#   Only use IP addresses â€” domain names will be ignored.  
#    
#   Advanced filtering is supported in this format:  
#       tcp/udp|in/out|s/d=port|s/d=ip  
#    
#   For more details, see readme.txt.  
#    
#   Note:   IPs listed here are NOT ignored by lfd. They may still be
#           blocked. To fully exclude an IP, add it to csf.ignore.

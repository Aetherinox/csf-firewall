     3.4 The Data Processor shall have and maintain a register of 
     processing activities in accordance with GDPR, article 32 (2). 

4. Instruction 

     4.1 The Data Processor may only act and process the Personal 
     Data in accordance with the documented instruction from the 
     Data Controller (the "Instruction"), unless required by law to 
     act without such instruction. The Instruction at the time of 
     entering into this Data Processor Agreement (DPA) is that the 
     Data Processor may only process the Personal Data with the 
     purpose of delivering the Main Services as described in the 
     Main Service Level Agreement. Subject to the terms of this 
     DPA and with mutual agreement of the parties, the Data 
     Controller may issue additional written instructions consistent 
     with the terms of this Agreement. The Data Controller is 
     responsible for ensuring that all individuals who provide 
     written instructions are authorised to do so. 

     4.2 The Data Controller guarantees to process Personal Data in 
     accordance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws and 
     Regulations. The Data Controller's instructions for the 
     processing of Personal Data shall comply with Applicable Law.

     instruction that it deems to be in violation of Applicable Law 
     and will not execute the instructions until they have been 
     confirmed or modified.

     5.1 Confidentiality 

          5.1.1 The Data Processor shall treat all the Personal Data as 
          strictly confidential information. The Personal Data may

          conflict with the Instruction, unless the Data Controller in 
          writing has agreed. 

          5.1.2 The Data Processor's employees shall be subject to 
          an obligation of confidentiality that ensures that the

          are subject to technical progress and development. The 
          Data Processor may update or modify the security 
          measures from time-to-time provided that such updates 
          and modifications do not result in the degradation of the 
          overall security.

     Data Processor's security measures if requested by the Data 
     Controller in writing.

          relevant, the Data Processor shall assist the Data 
          Controller in preparing data protection impact 
          assessments in accordance with GDPR, article 35, along 
          with any prior consultation in accordance with GDPR, 
          article 36.

          subject for the exercise of the data subject's rights under 
          the Applicable Law and the correct and legitimate reply to 
          such a request necessitates the Data Processor's 
          assistance, the Data Processor shall assist the Data 
          Controller by providing the necessary information and 
          documentation. The Data Processor shall be given 
          reasonable time to assist the Data Controller with such 
          requests in accordance with the Applicable Law.

          must immediately forward the request to the Data 
          Controller and must refrain from responding to the person 
          directly. 

     5.7 Personal Data Breaches 

          5.7.1 The Data Processor shall give immediate notice to 
          the Data Controller if a breach occurs, that can lead to the

          unauthorized disclosure of or access to, personal data 
          transmitted, stored or otherwise processed re the 
          Personal Data processed on behalf of the Data Controller 
          (a "Personal Data Breach"). 

          5.7.2 The Data Processor shall make reasonable efforts to 
          identify the cause of such a breach and take those steps as 
          they deem necessary to establish the cause, and to 
          prevent such a breach from reoccurring.

     5.8 Documentation of compliance and Audit Rights

          5.8.1 Upon request by a Data Controller, the Data 
          Processor shall make available to the Data Controller all 
          relevant information necessary to demonstrate 
          compliance with this DPA, and shall allow for and 
          reasonably cooperate with audits, including inspections by 
          the Data Controller or an auditor mandated by the Data 
          Controller. The Data Controller shall give notice of any 
          audit or document inspection to be conducted and shall 
          make reasonable endeavours to avoid causing damage or 
          disruption to the Data Processors premises, equipment 
          and business in the course of such an audit or inspection. 
          Any audit or document inspection shall be carried out with 
          reasonable prior written notice of no less than 30 days, 
          and shall not be conducted more than once a year. 

          5.8.2 The Data Controller may be requested to sign a non-
          disclosure agreement reasonably acceptable to the Data 
          Processor before being furnished with the above.

          data to countries outside the European Economic Area. In 
          some cases, personal data will be saved on storage 
          solutions that have servers outside the European 
          Economic Area (EEA). Only those storage solutions that 
          provide secure services with adequate relevant safeguards 
          will be employed.

6. Sub-Processors

     6.1 The Data Processor is given general authorisation to engage 
     third-parties to process the Personal Data ("Sub-Processors") 
     without obtaining any further written, specific authorization from 
     the Data Controller, provided that the Data Processor notifies the 
     Data Controller in writing about the identity of a potential Sub-
     Processor (and its processors, if any) before any agreements are 
     made with the relevant Sub-Processors and before the relevant 
     Sub-Processor processes any of the Personal Data. If the Data 
     Controller wishes to object to the relevant Sub- Processor, the 
     Data Controller shall give notice hereof in writing within ten (10) 
     business days from receiving the notification from the Data 
     Processor. Absence of any objections from the Data Controller 
     shall be deemed consent to the relevant Sub-Processor. 

     6.2 In the event the Data Controller objects to a new Sub-
     Processor and the Data Processor cannot accommodate the Data 
     Controller's objection, the Data Controller may terminate the 
     Services by providing written notice to the Data Processor. 

     6.3 The Data Processor is accountable to the Data Controller for 
     any Sub-Processor in the same way as for its own actions and 
     omissions.

     Processor Agreement using the Sub- Processors listed in sub-
     appendix B. If the Data Processor initiates sub-processing with a 
     new Sub-Processor, such new Sub-Processor shall be added to the 
     list in sub-appendix B under paragraph 2.

     7.1 The Data Controller shall remunerate the Data Processor based 
     on time spent to perform the obligations under section 5.5, 5.6, 
     5.7 and 5.8 of this Data Processor Agreement based on the Data 
     Processor's hourly rates. 

     7.2 The Data Processor is also entitled to remuneration for any 
     time and material used to adapt and change the processing 
     activities in order to comply with any changes to the Data 
     Controller's Instruction, including implementation costs and 
     additional costs required to deliver the Main Services due to the 
     change in the Instruction. The Data Processor is exempted from 
     liability for non-performance with the Main Agreement if the 
     performance of the obligations under the Main Agreement would 
     be in conflict with any changed Instruction or if contractual 
     delivery in accordance with the changed Instruction is impossible. 
     This could for instance be the case; (i) if the changes to the 
     Instruction cannot technically, practically or legally be 
     implemented; (ii) where the Data Controller explicitly requires 
     that the changes to the Instruction shall be applicable before the 
     changes can be implemented; and (iii) in the period of time until 
     the Main Agreement is changed to reflect the new Instruction and 
     commercial terms thereof.

     whether in contract, tort or otherwise, of the Data Processor for

     "Limitation of Liability" clause set out in the Main Service Level 
     Agreement.

     law to retain some or all of the Personal Data (in which case the 
     Data Processor will archive the data and implement reasonable

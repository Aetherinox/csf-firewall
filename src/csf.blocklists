#   This file contains definitions to IP BLOCK lists.
#   
#   Uncomment the line starting with the rule name to use it, then restart csf
#   and then lfd
#
#   Each block list must be listed on per line: as NAME|INTERVAL|MAX|URL
#       NAME      : List name with all uppercase alphabetic characters with no
#                   spaces and a maximum of 25 characters - this will be used as the
#                   iptables chain name
#       INTERVAL  : Refresh interval to download the list, must be a minimum of 3600
#                   seconds (an hour), but 86400 (a day) should be more than enough
#       MAX       : This is the maximum number of IP addresses to use from the list,
#                   a value of 0 means all IPs
#       URL       : The URL to download the list from
#   
#   Note: Some of these lists may be very long and could cause serious network
#   and/or performance issues unless you are using LF_IPSET in csf, so setting a
#   value for the MAX field should be considered
#   
#   After making any changes to this file you must restart csf and then lfd
#   
#   If you want to redownload a blocklist you must first delete
#   /var/lib/csf/csf.block.NAME and then restart csf and then lfd
#   
#   Each URL is scanned for an IP/CIDR address per line and if found is blocked
#   
#   The downloaded list can be a zip file. The zip file MUST only contain a
#   single text file of a single IP/CIDR per line
#   
#   Note: CXS_ is a reserved prefix for the blocklist name and MUST NOT be used
# #

#   The official CSF blocklists contain a large number of IPs which range from various 
#   different services, including AbuseIPDB (100% confidency).
#   
#   We offer many others, but these two are the primary ones.
#   
#   Requires you to edit /etc/csf/csf.conf setting:

#   This file lists usernames allowed to log via syslog/rsyslog. Users listed
#   here will be added to the system group defined by RESTRICT_SYSLOG_GROUP
#   in /etc/csf/csf.conf if RESTRICT_SYSLOG is set to "3".
#   
#   Warning:    This WILL break cron logging in /var/log/cron for users not
#               listed here.
#   
#   Remove any accounts that do not apply to your server. Add any accounts
#   that log through syslog which you need to allow.
#   
#   Only add user accounts (and the default apache account only if
#   absolutely necessary).
#   
#   Adding unnecessary accounts reduces the security value of this feature.

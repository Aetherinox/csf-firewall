# #
#   The following FQDNs will be allowed through the firewall. This is controlled
#   by lfd, which checks the DNS resolution of the FQDN and adds the IP address
#   into the ALLOWDYNIN and ALLOWDYNOUT iptables chains. lfd will check for IP
#   updates every DYNDNS seconds if set.
#   
#   If the FQDN has multiple A records, then all IP addresses will be processed.
#   If IPV6 is enabled and the perl module Socket6 from cpan.org is installed,
#   then all IPv6 AAAA records will also be allowed.
#   
#   Only list fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) in this file, either on their
#   own to allow full access, or using Advanced Allow/Deny Filters (see
#   readme.txt).

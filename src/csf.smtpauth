#   The following IP addresses will allow EXIM to advertise SMTP AUTH.
#   One IP address per line.
#   
#   CIDR addressing is supported, for example:
#       192.168.254.0/24
#   
#   Only list IP addresses â€” domain names will be ignored.
#   
#   To use this file, you must enable SMTPAUTH_RESTRICT and modify the Exim
#   configuration. CC_ALLOW_SMTPAUTH can also be used to allow entire country
#   codes.

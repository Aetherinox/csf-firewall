# The following is a list of files that lfd directory watching will ignore. You
# must specify the full path to the file
#
# You can also use perl regular expression pattern matching, for example:
# /tmp/clamav.*
# /tmp/.*\.wrk
#
# Remember that you will need to escape special characters (precede them with a
# backslash) such as \. \?
#
# Pattern matching will only occur with strings containing an asterix (*),
# otherwise full file path matching will be applied
#
# You can also add entries to ignore files owner by a particular user by
# preceding it with user:, for example:
# user:bob
#
# Note: files owned by root are ignored

#/tmp/\.horde
#/tmp/\.horde/.*

/tmp/yarn--[\d\-\.]+/(node|yarn)

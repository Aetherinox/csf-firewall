#   The following is a list of files that lfd directory watching will
#   ignore. You must specify the full path to each file.
#   
#   You can also use perl regular expression pattern matching, for
#   example:
#       /tmp/clamav.*
#       /tmp/.*\.wrk
#   
#   Remember to escape special characters (precede them with a
#   backslash) such as:
#       \. \?
#   
#   Pattern matching will only occur with strings containing an
#   asterisk (*), otherwise full file path matching will be applied.
#   
#   You can also add entries to ignore files owned by a particular
#   user by preceding it with user:, for example:
#       user:bob
#   
#   Note:   Files owned by root are ignored.
# #

#/tmp/\.horde
#/tmp/\.horde/.*
#/tmp/yarn--[\d\-\.]+/(node|yarn)
#/tmp/\.spamassassin.*

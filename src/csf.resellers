#   The following is a list of Reseller accounts that you want to allow access to
#   limited csf functionality.
#   
#   WARNING: You should only provide access to this facility to people you
#   trust. It could easily render your server inaccessible or open to attack.
#   For security reasons, resellers cannot list blocked IP addresses or the
#   entire iptables configuration. They must know the IP addresses they want
#   to use with this facility.
#   
#   You should list each account, one per line, followed by a colon, then a 0
#   or 1 depending on whether you want an email alert sent using the email
#   template reselleralert.txt whenever an ALLOW/DENY or UNBLOCK is performed,
#   then a colon, then a comma separated list of the feature codes that you
#   want each reseller to have access to.
#   
#   As of writing, the following is a list of available feature codes. More
#   may be added in the future, in which case they will be listed in the main
#   csf readme.txt:
#   
#       USE        - The reseller can use this facility through WHM (required)
#       UNBLOCK    - The reseller can use the Quick Unblock feature
#       GREP       - The reseller can use the Search IP feature
#       ALLOW      - The reseller can use the Quick Allow feature
#       DENY       - The reseller can use the Quick Deny feature
#   
#   For example, to allow reseller "someuser" to unblock IP addresses and have
#   an alert email sent to root, use:
#   
#       someuser:1:USE,UNBLOCK
#   
#   For example, to allow reseller "someuser" to allow, deny, and unblock IP
#   addresses, but no alert sent, use:
#   
#       someuser:0:USE,ALLOW,DENY,UNBLOCK
#   
#   RECOMMEND: For security reasons, we recommend only allowing resellers
#   USE, UNBLOCK, and GREP.
#   
#   NOTE:   As of version cPanel v11.8.1, you must additionally grant resellers
#           access via "WHM > Edit Reseller Nameservers and Privileges >
#           Third Party Services > ConfigServer Security & Firewall (Reseller UI)".

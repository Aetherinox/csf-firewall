Upgrade
=======

Upgrading is just a matter of following the installation instructions which are
non-destructive, i.e. it won't overwrite any configuration files and will
automagically add any new parameters to csf.conf for you. There is no need to
uninstall csf first.

Once done you should restart csf and lfd either in WHM, or:

csf -r
service lfd restart

The installation will not overwrite any of your current configuration settings
files.

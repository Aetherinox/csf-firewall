# #
#   This file contains IP addresses that are explicitly whitelisted in CSF.
#   These IPs belong to Sectigo (formerly Comodo), the SSL provider used by
#   cPanel’s free AutoSSL system (available in version 58 and later).
#   
#   Whitelisting ensures that connections from Sectigo are never blocked by
#   firewall rules, allowing SSL certificates to be issued and renewed without
#   interruption.
#   
#   If you prefer not to whitelist these IPs, remove the "Include" line for this
#   file from your csf.allow configuration. That include entry is only added once.
#   
#   ⚠️ Note:    This file is automatically managed by cPanel and CSF updates.
#               Do NOT manually modify or remove entries in this file, as your
#               changes will be overwritten during updates.
# #

# #
#   There is confusion about the difference between the files:
#       - cpanel.comodo.allow
#       - cpanel.comodo.ignore
#   
#   cpanel.comodo.allow                 Whitelist Sectigo IPs through the firewall.
#                  Desc:                Ensure cPanel’s AutoSSL servers can reach
#                                           your server — no firewall blocks.
#               Affects:                iptables
#   
#   cpanel.comodo.ignore                Exclude Sectigo IPs from login/banning checks.
#                  Desc:                Prevents CSF’s brute-force detection system
#                                           from accidentally blocking them.
#               Affects:                lfd (Login Failure Daemon)

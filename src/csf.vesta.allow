#   The following IP addresses will be allowed through iptables.
#   One IP address per line.
#   
#   CIDR addressing is supported (e.g., 192.168.254.0/24).
#   
#   Only list IP addresses â€” domain names will be ignored.
#   
#   Advanced port+IP filtering is allowed using this format:
#       tcp/udp|in/out|s/d=port|s/d=ip
#   
#   See readme.txt for more information.
#   
#   Note:   IP addresses listed here are NOT ignored by lfd and may still be
#           blocked. To prevent lfd from blocking an IP, add it to csf.ignore.

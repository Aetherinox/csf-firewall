#   The following IP addresses will be ignored by LFD (Login Failure Daemon)
#   and allowed through iptables to ensure uninterrupted communication with
#   cPanel license servers.
#   
#   These IPs belong to cPanel and are responsible for authenticating licenses
#   and maintaining proper cPanel service functionality.
#   
#   The "ignore" file specifically tells LFD to not block or trigger alerts
#   for these IPs. Traffic is allowed through the firewall automatically, but
#   LFD monitoring is bypassed.
#   
#   ⚠️ Note:    This file is automatically managed by CSF and will be replaced
#               during upgrades. Do NOT edit manually. If you do not want these
#               IPs ignored, remove the "Include" line from csf.ignore in
#               the main configuration.

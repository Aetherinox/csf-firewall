#   the master list is the primary list available in this repository.
#   it is what most people should choose when looking to stop bad actors
#   from accessing your servers, as it includes various online services
#   mixed into one, and with validation in place to ensure that each
#   ip is indeed associated to a system that has performed actions such
#   as port sniffing / scanning, ssh brute force attacks, ddos attacks,
#   dns poisoning, fraud, exploited hosts, email spam, etc.
#
#   By using this list, you should not block off access to legitimate
#   servers such as Cloudflare, Amazon, Microsoft, etc, unless that
#   server has been rented by an outside party who utilized it to
#   commit nefarious acts.

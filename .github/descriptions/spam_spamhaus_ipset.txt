#   The Spamhaus Project is an international organisation based in
#   the Principality of Andorra, founded in 1998 by Steve Linford
#   to track email spammers and spam-related activity
#
#   The DROP (Don't Route Or Peer) lists are a subset of the
#   Spamhaus Blocklist (SBL), designed for a total protection
#   from all the activity involving the listed networks over all
#   the Internet protocols. This also specifically includes
#   traffic directed to these networks, such as access to web
#   sites hosted there.
#
#   DROP will only include netblocks allocated directly by an
#   established Regional Internet Registry (RIR) or 
#   National Internet Registry (NIR) such as ARIN, RIPE, AFRINIC,
#   APNIC, LACNIC or KRNIC or direct RIR allocations.
#
#   Contains 1300+ subnets, 1,590,0000+ unique IPs

#   UptimeRobot is a service that monitors your websiteâ€™s uptime and alerts you when it goes
#   down. By integrating UptimeRobot with RunCloud, you can monitor all of your websites hosted
#   on RunCloud servers, and access a number of features and benefits from both.
#
#   It achieves this by sending requests to your website at regular intervals and checking the
#   response status code, response time, and keyword presence. If the response is not satisfactory,
#   UptimeRobot will notify you via email, SMS, webhook, or other method of your choice.
